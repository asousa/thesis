abstract = {The properties of the plasmapause as a VLF wave guide are studied. The guidance that occurs is a form of gradient trapping of VLF wave energy. It is shown that guiding is possible at both the inner and outer edges of the plasmapause and that more efficient guiding occurs as the plasmapause gradients become stronger. In the case of strong gradients, waves coming from a wide latitude range (∼8°) are focused tightly about the plasmapause field lines, resulting in a wave intensity increase of approximately 3 dB near the magnetic equatorial plane. It is shown that plasmapause-guided waves can be observed on the ground and can echo between hemispheres, precisely as can waves guided in normal whistler ducts. The single distinguishing feature of plasmapause-guided waves is a lowered upper cutoff frequency. The results indicate that the vicinity of the plasmapause represents a natural and readily accessible region of VLF wave guidance and focusing where both passive and active VLF experiments can be studied through ground and in situ satellite measurements.},

@article{Gallagher1999,
abstract = {Over 40 years of ground and spacecraft plasmaspheric measurements have resulted in many statistical descriptions of plasmaspheric properties. In some cases, these properties have been represented as analytical descriptions that are valid for specific regions or conditions. For the most part, what has not been done is to extend regional empirical descriptions or models to the plasmasphere as a whole. In contrast, many related investigations depend on the use of representative plasmaspheric conditions throughout the inner magnetosphere. Wave propagation, involving the transport of energy through the magnetosphere, is strongly affected by thermal plasma density and its composition. Ring current collisional and wave particle losses also strongly depend on these quantities. Plasmaspheric also plays a secondary role in influencing radio signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) is an attempt to assimilate previous empirical evidence and regional models for plasmaspheric density into a continuous, smooth model of thermal plasma density in the inner magnetosphere. In that spirit, the International Reference Ionosphere is currently used to complete the low altitude description of density and composition in the model. The models and measurements on which the GCPM is currently based and its relationship to IRI will be discussed.},

@article{Hoerlin1976,
abstract = {The US high-altitude nuclear explosions of the 1955-1962 period are listed chronologically; dates, locations, and yields are given. The major physical phases of the interactions of the weapon outputs with the atmosphere are described, such as the formation of fweballs at the low high-altitudes and the partition of energies and their distribution over very large spaces at the higher high-altitudes. The effects of these explosions on the normal activities of populations and the protective measures taken are documented. Many scientific observations, together with their significance and values, are reviewed. The prompt thermal effects on the ground were negligible, with the exception of those from the Orange event. That event could have caused minor damage in the Johnston Island (JI) area in the absence of cloud cover. The eyeburn problem at ground zero and up to large slant distances was severe for all events except Starfish, Checkmate, and Argus. Adequate precautions, such as the selection of JI instead of Bikini as the base in the Pacific, were taken. Two military personnel suffered severe burns, however, due to inadvertent exposure. Their case histories are recorded. The degrading effects of increased ionospheric ionization on commercial and aircraft communications-mainly in the LF, MF, and HF frequency ranges—extended over the whole Pacific Ocean area. They lasted for many days after the three megaton-range explosions. They were less severe—in some cases even beneficial-for VHF and VLF frequencies, thus providing guidance for emergency situations. The formation of an artificial radiation belt of such high electron fluxes and long lifetimes as occurred after the Startlsh event was unexpected; so were the damages sustained by three satellites in orbit. However, the vast amount of knowledge gained by the observations of the artificial belts generated by Starfish, Argus, and the Russian high-altitude explosions far outweighed the information which would have been gained otherwise. A few extrapolations are made to effects on manned space flight under hypothetical circumstances. Electromagnetic radiation in the radio-frequency portion of the spectrum (EMP) caused brief outages of a street lighting system in Oahu and of several input stages of electronic equipment, though during the Starfish event only. 1 The worldwide auroral phenomena produced by the high-yield explosions were spectacular but of no consequence to ordinary human activities. They increased substantially our basic knowledge of auroral-type light-producing processes. Questions were raised but not answered as to the effects of pertinent energy depositions on large-scale weather patterns. The prompt fallout from high-altitude explosions was zero. The residence time in the stratosphere of special tracers—'02Rh and ‘“'Cd—incorporated into the Orange and Starfish devices was 14 years. The fallout of fission products was similarly delayed and was distributed over the whole globe; thus, the biological effects on humans were reduced per unit energy release in comparison with low-altitude atmospheric explosions. The worldwide observation of the tracers led to the development of matching models of global stratospheric air-mass motions and to a better understanding of mixing processes near the tropopause. In fact, the downward motion of the tracers was most pronounced in the polar areas during local winter. No effect on the natural ozone layer could be ascertained. In summary, the effects of the US high-altitude explosions on the normal activities of the populations were either insignificant or under protective control involving little harassment or irritation. As to the effects on the research activities of the international scientific community, I believe, in retrospect, that the early apprehension both in the US and Great Britain has given way now to a more positive assessment of the scientific returns obtained. However, it is also evident that the consequences of massive military operations in the upper atmosphere would be grave.},

@article{Shprits2005,
abstract = {A time dependent radial diffusion model is used to quantify the competing effects of inward radial diffusion and losses on the distribution of the outer zone relativistic electrons. The rate of radial diffusion is parameterized by Kp with the loss time as an adjustable parameter. Comparison with HEEF data taken over 500 Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) orbits indicates that 1-MeV electron lifetimes near the peak of the outer zone are less than a day during the storm main phase and few days under less disturbed conditions. These values are comparable to independent estimates of the storm time loss rate due to scattering by EMIC waves and chorus emission, and also provide an acceptable representation of electron decay rates following the storm time injection. Although our radial diffusion model, with data derived lifetimes, is able to simulate many features of the variability of outer zone fluxes and predicts fluxes within one order of magnitude accuracy for most of the storms and L values, it fails to reproduce the magnitude of flux changes and the gradual build up of fluxes observed during the recovery phase of many storms. To address these differences future modeling should include an additional local acceleration source and also attempt to simulate the pronounced loss of electrons during the main phase of certain storms.},

We quantify the Landau damping of MR whistlers, using recent energetic electron data from the HYDRA instrument on POLAR and show that the MR wave components can endure for as long as ∼20 seconds and undergo as many as 17 reflections before experiencing a 6 dB power loss due to Landau damping. Our results suggest that MR whistler wave energy may thus significantly enhance the total amount of energetic electron precipitation induced by each individual lightning discharge.},

@article{Massey1998,
abstract = {In this book, Doreen Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our imagination of space. She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space. The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. For Space pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.},

The region between the belts is normally devoid of particles2–4 , and is accordingly favoured as a location for space- craft operation because of the benign environment5 . Here we report that the outer Van Allen belt was compressed dramatically by a solar stormknown as the ‘Hallowe'en storm' of 2003. From 1 to 10 November, the outer belt had its centre only ,10,000km from Earth's equatorial surface, and the plasmasphere was similarly displaced inwards.

abstract = {Lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) from the Earth's radiation belt has been observed on numerous occasions with detectors on the low-altitude S81-1/SEEP satellite. A sequence of seven LEP events on September 9, 1982, and eight events on October 20, 1982, are correlated on a one-to-one basis with one-hop whistlers at Palmer, Antarctica. The temporal profile within a LEP burst has a remarkable fine structure. It is shown to be associated with bunches of magnetically guided and focused 100-to-200 keV electrons that are repeatedly scattered by the atmosphere and bounce between the northern and southern hemispheres. The delay time between the lightning sferic and the arrival of the first electron bunch increases with increasing L as predicted by the first-order gyroresonance theory. The global distribution of strong LEP events observed with the SEEP payload correlates with lightning activity and shows a preferred distribution at 2{\textless}L{\textless}3. This L shell range corresponds to the slot region in the electron radiation belt. A single LEP burst (10-3ergs-1cm-2) in the slot region is estimated to deplete {\~{}}0.001{\%} of the particles in the region covered by the burst magnetic field lines. The evidence supports the production of structured LEP by ducted rather than nonducted whistlers. It is found that ducted whistlers can be an important pitch angle diffusion mechanism for 100-250 keV electrons in the 2{\textless}L{\textless}3 range although a number of uncertainties in the various parameters remain to be resolved. It is suggested that observations of LEP can be a new tool to measure the presence and transverse dimensions of plasmaspheric whistler mode ducts.},

abstract = {A three dimensional ray tracing of whistler-mode chorus is performed in a realistic magnetosphere using the HOTRAY code. A variety of important propagation characteristics are revealed associated with azimuthal density gradients and a plasmaspheric plume. Specifically, whistler mode chorus originating from a broad region on the dayside can propagate into the plasmasphere. After entry into the plasmasphere, waves can propagate eastward in MLT and merge to form hiss. This explains how chorus generated on the dayside can contribute to plasmaspheric hiss in the dusk sector. A subset of waves entering the plasmasphere can even propagate globally onto the nightside.

abstract = {The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)-Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma (ECT) suite contains an innovative complement of particle instruments to ensure the highest quality measurements ever made in the inner magnetosphere and radiation belts. The coordinated RBSP-ECT particle measurements, analyzed in combination with fields and waves observations and state-of-the-art theory and modeling, are necessary for understanding the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions, key science objectives of NASA's Living With a Star program and the Van Allen Probes mission. The RBSP-ECT suite consists of three highly-coordinated instruments: the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) sensor, and the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT). Collectively they cover, continuously, the full electron and ion spectra from one eV to 10's of MeV with sufficient energy resolution, pitch angle coverage and resolution, and with composition measurements in the critical energy range up to 50 keV and also from a few to 50 MeV/nucleon. All three instruments are based on measurement techniques proven in the radiation belts. The instruments use those proven techniques along with innovative new designs, optimized for operation in the most extreme conditions in order to provide unambiguous separation of ions and electrons and clean energy responses even in the presence of extreme penetrating background environments. The design, fabrication and operation of ECT spaceflight instrumentation in the harsh radiation belt environment ensure that particle measurements have the fidelity needed for closure in answering key mission science questions. ECT instrument details are provided in companion papers in this same issue.},

abstract = {On the basis of the correlation between the solar wind and radiation belt electron fluxes, we develop a model to simulate the MeV electron phase space density variations from L = 3 to L = 8 by extending the Li et al. (2001) radial diffusion model for geosynchronous electrons. We add L dependence to the Li et al. model and allow for comparison with measurements at more than one L shell while retaining a similar form of their diffusion coefficient. The extended model achieves a prediction efficiency (PE) of 0.61 at L = 4 and 0.52 at L = 6 when the phase space density is converted to differential flux and compared with orbit-averaged Polar 2 MeV measurements at L = 4 and daily averaged LANL 0.7-1.8 MeV geosynchronous measurements for the year 1998. These results indicate that radial diffusion plays a strong role in the enhancement of radiation belt electrons yet leaves a significant portion of the variance unaccounted for. We have also tuned parameters to model the electron fluxes during four individual geomagnetic storms during 1998 and found that the parameter values must differ from those of the long term and from each other to achieve the best PE. This suggests that the different solar wind drivers have varying degrees of influence on the MeV electron variations during different magnetic storms. This model can be used to forecast the MeV electron variations inside geosynchronous orbit with a reasonably good PE on the basis of real-time solar wind measurements only.},

abstract = {Phase and amplitude perturbations (trimpis) on VLF signals propagating in the earth-ionosphere waveguide are usually explained in terms of precipitation-induced modification along the great circle path as though it were a one-dimensional (1-D) waveguide. The alternative 2-D view presented here is that precipitation-induced ionization patches, laterally displaced from the great circle path, produce echoes at the receiver slightly delayed relative to the direct signal. Interference between the direct and echo signals can produce both phase and amplitude trimpis of both signs. Single-mode propagation is assumed here, since it is likely that the second mode amplitude exceeded that of the first by ∼12 dB. We apply this theory to a sequence of trimpis observed on the North West Cape (NWC)-Dunedin path on July 10, 1987. This indicates a north–south drift of the precipitation region consistent with drift speeds of whistler ducts. The theory is also applied to events published in the literature.},

Good angle accuracy is obtained by measuring the lightning direction at just the time the return-stroke electro-magnetic field reaches its initial peak. Lightning locations are calculated from the intersections of direction vectors and/or from the ratio of signal strengths recorded simultaneously at two, three, or four DF sites.

A total of 37 negative flashes that contained leader/return stroke sequences (a total of 139) were triggered during these years. For all the return strokes, locations of channel terminations on the ground were known exactly, and for 122 of them currents were measured directly using noninductive shunts. The NLDN recorded 105 Camp Blanding strokes in 34 flashes. The resultant flash and stroke detection efficiencies were 92{\%} and 76{\%}, respectively. The median absolute location error was 308 m. The median NLDN-estimated peak current error was −6.1{\%}, while the median absolute value of current estimation error was 13{\%}. Strokes in “classical” triggered flashes are similar to regular subsequent strokes (following previously formed channels) in natural lightning, and hence the results presented here are applicable only to regular negative subsequent strokes in natural lightning. The flash detection efficiency reported here is expected to be an underestimate of the true value for natural negative lightning flashes, since first strokes typically have larger peak currents than subsequent ones.},

abstract = {Energetic particle precipitation couples the solar wind to the Earth's atmosphere and indirectly to Earth's climate. Ionisation and dissociation increases, due to particle precipitation, create odd nitrogen (NOx) and odd hydrogen (HOX) in the upper atmosphere, which can affect ozone chemistry. The long-lived NOx can be transported downwards into the stratosphere, particularly during the polar winter. Thus, the impact of NOx is determined by both the initial ionisation production, which is a function of the particle flux and energy spectrum, as well as transport rates. In this paper, we use the Sodankyl{\"{a}} Ion and Neurtal Chemistry (SIC) model to simulate the production of NOx from examples of the most representative particle flux and energy spectra available today of solar proton events (SPE), auroral energy electrons, and relativistic electron precipitation (REP). Large SPEs are found to produce higher initial NOx concentrations than long-lived REP events, which themselves produce higher initial NOx levels than auroral electron precipitation. Only REP microburst events were found to be insignificant in terms of generating NOx. We show that the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) observations from the Arctic winter 2003-2004 are consistent with NOx generation by a combination of SPE, auroral altitude precipitation, and long-lived REP events.

abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes {\textgreater}40 kev and proton fluxes {\textgreater}120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10−2$\gamma$, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents results and analysis regarding the use of anthropogenic ground-based and space-based Very Low Frequency (VLF) transmitters to precipitate energetic electrons in the inner radiation belt. While existing ground-based VLF transmitters already precipitate energetic electrons, they do so inadvertently. In this work, we consider sources designed specifically for the purpose of precipitating {\textgreater}100 keV electrons. This concept is termed controlled precipitation. We focus on this energy range because these electrons are most damaging from a so-called space weather perspective. We initially consider the distribution of whistler-mode wave energy from space- based sources distributed in L -shell and geomagnetic latitude. We also incorporate the effects of VLF antenna radiation immersed in a magnetoplasma. Our results demonstrate that a space-based source, by varying the frequency of the injected waves, can target L -shells both higher and lower than the source site, with wave frequencies below (above) the local lower hybrid resonance frequency moving to higher (lower) L -shells. We show that only three sources placed at various locations in the inner magnetosphere are required to project wave power over the range 1.4{\textless}= L {\textless}=2.7, which comprises the bulk of the inner radiation belt. We also calculate the energetic electron precipitation that would be induced by waves injected by such sources. The waves injected by space-based sources propagate with highly oblique wave normal angles close to the local resonance cone. In contrast with previous analysis, we show that these waves do induce substantial {\textgreater}1 MeV electron precipitation. Compared to a single-pass interaction, highly oblique magnetospherically reflecting whistler- mode waves precipitate up to 16 times more 100 keV to 5 MeV electrons. Waves injected at initial wave normal angles closer to the magnetic field, e.g., 45°, in fact precipitate fewer {\textgreater}1 MeV electrons than waves injected close to the resonance cone. We also investigate the tradeoffs among source location, operating frequency and radiated power for ground-based VLF sources designed to precipitate energetic electrons in the inner radiation belts. We determine energetic electron precipitation signatures induced by five existing ground-based VLF sources as well as five different hypothetical transmitters distributed broadly in geomagnetic latitude with a wide range of operating frequencies. We show that source location affects induced precipitation more strongly than operating frequency or radiated power. Sources located at 35° to 45° induce the most {\textgreater}100 keV precipitation for the 10 to 40 kHz waves typical of ground-based VLF sources, while locations below l{\~{}}=15° or above l{\~{}}=55° are least effective at precipitating energetic electrons. In all cases, induced precipitation increases as the operating frequency decreases, with 10 kHz waves from a source at l{\~{}}=35° the most effective at precipitating {\textgreater}100 keV electrons. Precipitation signatures produced by five existing ground-based VLF transmitters are also simulated: the NAA, NLK, NAU, NPM, and NWC VLF transmitters. Among these, the NWC transmitter located at a geomagnetic latitude of 31.7° in western Australia induces the strongest {\textgreater}100 keV electron precipitation signature, followed by the NPM, NAU, NAA and NLK transmitters.},

abstract = {A composite model of wave propagation from terrestrial very low frequency (VLF) transmitters has been constructed to estimate the wave normal angles and fields of whistler mode waves in the plasmasphere. The model combines a simulation of the fields in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, ionospheric absorption estimates, and geomagnetic field and plasma density models with fully three-dimensional ray tracing that includes refraction, focusing, and resonant damping. The outputs of this model are consistent with those of several previous, simpler simulations, some of which have underlying component models in common. A comparison of the model outputs to wavefield data from five satellites shows that away from the magnetic equator, all of the models systematically overestimate the median field strength in the plasmasphere owing to terrestrial VLF transmitters by about 20 dB at night and at least 10 dB during the day. In addition, wavefield estimates at L {\textless} 1.5 in the equatorial region appear to be about 15 dB too low, although measured fields there are extremely variable. Consideration of the models' similarities and differences indicates that this discrepancy originates in or below the ionosphere, where important physics (as yet not conclusively identified) is not being modeled. Adjustment of the low-altitude field estimates downward by constant factors brings the model outputs into closer agreement with satellite observations. It is concluded that past and future use of these widely employed trans-ionospheric VLF propagation models should be reevaluated.},

abstract = {This study explores the manner in which the plasmapause is responsible for dictating which magnetospheric source regions of ELF/VLF chorus are able to propagate to and be received by midlatitude stations on the ground. First, we explore the effects of plasmapause extent on ground-based observations of chorus via a 3 month study of ground-based measurements of chorus at Palmer Station, Antarctica (L = 2.4, 50°S geomagnetic latitude), and data on the plasmapause extent from the IMAGE EUV instrument. It is found that chorus normalized occurrence peaks when the plasmapause is at L ∼ 2.6, somewhat higher than Palmer's L shell, and that this occurrence peak persists across a range of observed chorus frequencies. Next, reverse ray tracing is employed to evaluate the portion of the equatorial chorus source region, distributed in radial distance and wave normal, from which chorus is able to reach Palmer Station via propagation in a nonducted mode. The results of ray tracing are similar to those of observations, with a peak of expected occurrence when the plasmapause is at L ∼ 3. The exact location of the peak is frequency dependent. This supports the conclusion that the ability of chorus to propagate to low altitudes and the ground is a strong function of instantaneous plasmapause extent and that peak occurrence of chorus at a given ground station may occur when the L shell of the plasmapause is somewhat beyond that of the observing station. These results also suggest that chorus observed on the ground at midlatitude stations propagates predominantly in the nonducted mode. },

abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes {\textgreater}40 kev and proton fluxes {\textgreater}120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10−2$\gamma$, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

A statistical study of chorus during geomagnetic storms observed by the Van Allen Probes found that frequencies are often dramatically lower than expected. The frequency at peak power suddenly stops tracking the equatorial 0.5 fce and f/fce decreases rapidly, often to frequencies well below 0.1 fce (in situ and mapped to equator). These very low frequency waves are observed both when the satellites are close to the equatorial plane and at higher magnetic latitudes. Poynting flux is consistent with generation at the equator. Wave amplitudes can be up to 20 to 40mV/m and 2 to 4 nT. We conclude that conditions during moderate to large storms can excite unusually low frequency chorus, which is resonant with more energetic electrons than typical chorus, with critical implications for understanding radiation belt evolution.},

The formula is valid in a lossy plasma and for any dipole orientation with respect to the magnetic field. The dipole impedance is found to have a positive real part under lossless conditions when the quasi-static differential equation is hyperbolic; this indicates that the quasi-static theory predicts a form of radiation. It is shown that the quasi-static theory can be interpreted in terms of scaled coordinates and that a cylindrical dipole in a magnetoplasma has a free space equivalent with a distorted shape. A conductance correction term obtained from Langmuir probe theory is shown to be significant. Laboratory measurements of monopole impedance are compared with the theoretical calculations.},

The original mathematical form of the diffusive equilibrium model was based on the hydrostatic equilibrium along the magnetic field line with the centrifugal force and the field-aligned electrostatic force as well as a large number of simplifying approximations. Six free parameters in the mathematical form have been conventionally determined from observations. We evaluate four sets of the parameters that have been reported in the literature. The evaluation is made according to the equatorial radial distance dependence, latitudinal dependence at a given radial distance, and the combined radial and latitudinal dependences. We find that the mathematical form given in the diffusive equilibrium model is intrinsically incompatible with the measurements unless another large number of free parameters are artificially introduced, which essentially changes the nature of a theoretical model to an empirical model.},

abstract = {We present a new computer code (PADIE) that calculates fully relativistic quasi-linear pitch angle and energy diffusion coefficients for resonant wave-particle interactions in a magnetized plasma. Unlike previous codes, the full electromagnetic dispersion relation is used so that interactions involving any linear electromagnetic wave mode in a predominantly cold plasma can be addressed for any ratio of the plasma-frequency to the cyclotron frequency $\omega$pe  /∣$\Omega$e∣. The code can be applied to problems in astrophysical, magnetospheric, and laboratory plasmas. The code is applied here to the Earth's radiation belts to calculate electron diffusion by whistler mode chorus, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC), and Z mode waves. The high-density approximation is remarkably good for electron diffusion by whistler mode chorus for energies E ≥ 100 keV, even for $\omega$pe/∣$\Omega$e∣ ≈ 2 but underestimates diffusion by orders of magnitude at low energies (∼10 keV). When a realistic angular spread of propagating waves is introduced for EMIC waves, electron diffusion at ∼0.5 MeV is only slightly reduced compared with the assumption of field-aligned propagation, but at ∼5 MeV, electron diffusion at pitch angles near 90° is reduced by a factor of 5 and increased by several orders of magnitude at pitch angles 30°–80°. Scattering by EMIC waves should contribute to flattening of the distribution function. The first results for electron diffusion by Z mode waves are presented. They show that unlike the whistler and EMIC waves, energy diffusion exceeds pitch angle diffusion over a broad range of pitch angles less than 45°. The results suggest that Z mode waves could provide a significant contribution to electron acceleration in the radiation belts during storm times.},

The signal amplitude changes are attributed to increased absorption in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and{\&}sol;or alterations of the waveguide mode structure due to localized secondary ionization enhancements produced in the nighttime lower ionosphere and the mesosphere by the precipitating electrons. The otherwise stably trapped electrons are believed to be scattered in pitch angle during cyclotron resonant interactions in the magnetosphere with the lightning-generated whistler waves. That some precipitation bursts consist partly of MeV electrons is suggested by (i) confinement of the perturbed subionospheric signal path to low magnetic latitudes ( L {\&}le; 1.8), for which corresponding electron energies for gyroresonance with typical whistler-wave frequencies in the magnetosphere are {\textgreater} 1 MeV, and (ii) the temporal signatures of the perturbation events, which often exhibit an unusually rapid initial recovery (time constant of {\&}tau; {\textless} 1 s) followed by further recovery at rates believed characteristic of less energetic events ({\&}tau; {\&}sim; 5-20 s). The latter is interpreted as a manifestation of the rapid variation with altitude of the effective loss rate for excess ionization over an exceptionally wide range of mesospheric altitudes (40-70 km) penetrated by the {\textgreater} 1 MeV electrons.},

abstract = {Ray tracing for whistler-mode propagation has been performed with the effects of ions included. The method is similar to that employed by Yabroff but for the modification in the refractive index due to ions. Outstanding characteristics of the ray paths in such a medium result from the existence of purely transverse propagation at the lower frequencies.

We find that a recent maximum in AE or minimum in Dst provides a better model of the plasmapause radius than does maximum Kp. AE and Dst measure specific current systems (the auroral electrojet and ring current, respectively). The AE model suggests that substorms may be involved in the erosion of the plasmapause.

abstract = {The flux of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt can vary by several orders of magnitude over time scales less than a day, in response to changes in properties of the solar wind instigated by solar activity. Variability in the radiation belts is due to an imbalance between the dominant source and loss processes, caused by a violation of one or more of the adiabatic invariants. For radiation belt electrons, non‐adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understand- ing and global modeling of such wave‐particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

abstract = {The Electric Fields and Waves (EFW) Instruments on the two Radiation Belt Storm Probe (RBSP) spacecraft (recently renamed the Van Allen Probes) are designed to measure three dimensional quasi-static and low frequency electric fields and waves associ- ated with the major mechanisms responsible for the acceleration of energetic charged par- ticles in the inner magnetosphere of the Earth. For this measurement, the instrument uses two pairs of spherical double probe sensors at the ends of orthogonal centripetally deployed booms in the spin plane with tip-to-tip separations of 100 meters. The third component of the electric field is measured by two spherical sensors separated by ∼15 m, deployed at the ends of two stacer booms oppositely directed along the spin axis of the spacecraft. The instrument provides a continuous stream of measurements over the entire orbit of the low frequency electric field vector at 32 samples/s in a survey mode. This survey mode also includes measurements of spacecraft potential to provide information on thermal electron plasma variations and structure. Survey mode spectral information allows the continuous evaluation of the peak value and spectral power in electric, magnetic and density fluctua- tions from several Hz to 6.5 kHz. On-board cross-spectral data allows the calculation of field-aligned wave Poynting flux along the magnetic field. For higher frequency waveform information, two different programmable burst memories are used with nominal sampling rates of 512 samples/s and 16 k samples/s. The EFW burst modes provide targeted mea- surements over brief time intervals of 3-d electric fields, 3-d wave magnetic fields (from the EMFISIS magnetic search coil sensors), and spacecraft potential. In the burst modes all six sensor-spacecraft potential measurements are telemetered enabling interferometric timing of small-scale plasma structures. In the first burst mode, the instrument stores all or a sub- stantial fraction of the high frequency measurements in a 32 gigabyte burst memory. The sub-intervals to be downloaded are uplinked by ground command after inspection of instru- ment survey data and other information available on the ground. The second burst mode involves autonomous storing and playback of data controlled by flight software algorithms, which assess the “highest quality” events on the basis of instrument measurements and in- formation from other instruments available on orbit. The EFWinstrument provides 3-dwave electric field signals with a frequency response up to 400 kHz to the EMFISIS instrument for analysis and telemetry (Kletzing et al. Space Sci. Rev. 2013).},

@article{Tsyganenko2005,
abstract = {This work builds on and extends our previous effort (Tsyganenko et al., 2003) to develop a dynamical model of the storm-time geomagnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, using space magnetometer data taken during 37 major events in 1996–2000 and concurrent observations of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The essence of the approach is to derive from the data the temporal variation of all major current systems contributing to the distant geomagnetic field during the entire storm cycle, using a simple model of their growth and decay. Each principal source of the external magnetic field (magnetopause, cross-tail current sheet, axisymmetric and partial ring currents, and Birkeland current systems) is driven by a separate variable, calculated as a time integral of a combination of geoeffective parameters NlVbBs g, where N, V, and Bs are the solar wind density, speed, and the magnitude of the southward component of the IMF, respectively. In this approach we assume that each source has its individual relaxation timescale and residual quiet-time strength, and its partial contribution to the total field depends on the entire history of the external driving of the magnetosphere during a storm. In addition, the magnitudes of the principal field sources were assumed to saturate during extremely large storms with abnormally strong external driving. All the parameters of the model field sources, including their magnitudes, geometrical characteristics, solar wind/IMF driving functions, decay timescales, and saturation thresholds, were treated as free variables, and their values were derived from the data. As an independent consistency test, we calculated the expected Dst variation on the basis of the model output at Earth's surface and compared it with the actual observed Dst. A good agreement (cumulative correlation coefficient R = 0.92) was found, in spite of the fact that  90{\%} of the spacecraft data used in the fitting were taken at synchronous orbit and beyond, while only 3.7{\%} of those data came from distances 2.5   R   4 RE. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility to develop a truly dynamical model of the magnetic field, based on magnetospheric and interplanetary data and allowing one to reproduce and forecast the entire process of a geomagnetic storm, as it unfolds in time and space.},

abstract = {Lightning discharges generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak component in the very low frequency (VLF; 3–30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (≤6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1–4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between ∼40 and 60{\%} is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it uses less memory. Computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serious errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions.

Direct comparison with satellite observations indicates that the VLF wave intensities measured at satellite altitudes are substantially smaller than predicted. The apparent reduction in amplitude is attributed to the presence of irregularities in the ionosphere, which the waves encounter during their traversal of the lower ionosphere. Linear mode scattering from the irregularities convert the whistler waves into quasi-electrostatic whistler mode (QEWM) waves with wave normal angles near the resonance cone. Recent enhancements to the FWM are also described, which allow the minimization of an aliasing error encountered in taking the inverse Fourier transform.},

abstract = {The behavior of high-energy electrons trapped in the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts has been extensively studied, through both experimental and theoretical techniques. While the evidence for whistler induced electron precipitation (WEP) from the radiation belts is overwhelming, and the mechanisms behind WEP are well understood, the overall significance of WEP on radiation belt loss rates has not been clear. In this paper we investigate the L-shell variation and significance of WEP-driven loss of Van Allen belt electrons by combining in situ measurements of electron precipitation, local WEP rates determined from Trimpi perturbations, and global lightning distributions. Our modeling suggests that long-term WEP driven losses are more significant than all other inner radiation belt loss processes for electron kinetic energies in the range ∼50–150 keV in the L-shell range L = 2–2.4. These calculated lifetimes are comparable to the observed decay rates of artificially injected high-energy electrons. The upper energy limit of the WEP significance range increases with decreasing L to ∼225 keV at L = 2. For electron energies above this range manmade VLF transmitters and plasmaspheric hiss should dominate over all other loss processes. However, as our lifetimes are based on rather conservative parameter estimates, these conclusions should represent the lower bounds for the energy ranges over which WEP losses are significant. For lower L-shells the coupling of lightning activity to the production of WEP events rapidly decreases, such that by L ∼ 1.7 WEP will be unimportant in the overall loss processes.},

abstract = {Energetic electrons (E {\textgreater} 100 keV) in the Earth's radiation belts undergo Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonant interactions with a variety of whistler mode waves leading to pitch angle scattering and subsequent loss to the atmosphere. In this study we assess the relative importance of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning-generated whistlers in the slot region and beyond. Electron loss timescales are determined using the Pitch Angle and energy Diffusion of Ions and Electrons (PADIE) code with global models of the spectral distributions of the wave power based on CRRES observations. Our results show that plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles is a significant scattering agent in the slot region and beyond. In contrast, plasmaspheric hiss propagating at large wave normal angles and lightning-generated whistlers do not contribute significantly to radiation belt loss. The loss timescale of 2 MeV electrons due to plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles in the center of the slot region (L = 2.5) lies in the range 1–10 days, consistent with recent Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) observations. Wave turbulence in space, which is responsible for the generation plasmaspheric hiss, thus leads to the formation of the slot region. During active periods, losses due to plasmaspheric hiss may occur on a timescale of 1 day or less for a wide range of energies, 200 keV {\textless} E {\textless} 1 MeV, in the region 3.5 {\textless} L {\textless} 4.0. Plasmaspheric hiss may thus also be a significant loss process in the inner region of the outer radiation belt during magnetically disturbed periods.},

abstract = {Studying magnetically conjugate phenomena at very high latitudes requires a magnetic coordinate system that is smooth and well defined at the geographic poles. In addition, it should provide for accurate comparisons at different altitudes. In this report we present a variation on the corrected geomagnetic coordinate system that is well defined and smooth over the entire globe. It provides an analytic expression relating geographic coordinates, including altitude, to the magnetic coordinates. The coordinate system is produced by tracing magnetic field lines using the IGRF85 reference magnetic field model with time derivatives updating the model to 1988. An expansion of the relationship in terms of spherical harmonics has been determined, which then provides the required well-defined and smooth relationship over the entire globe. Independent expansions for different altitudes show a smooth functional relationship of the coefficients of the expansion with altitude, and therefore simple interpolation schemes can be used to provide an appropriate expansion at any altitude between 0 km and approximately 600 km. By reversing the process, the inverse expansions relating the magnetic coordinates to geographic coordinates have also been determined. The effects of the seasonal variation in the Sun's declination along with the variation in the Sun's apparent position due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit result in a variation of nearly 1 hour of magnetic local time for a fixed UT over the course of a year. In many applications this variation may be important and should be included when presenting data in terms of magnetic latitude and MLT.},

The imager detected ENA in the energy range 0.1 - 140 keV utilizing two different techniques. Neutrals of the energy 13 - 140 keV were recorded by 14 solid state detectors with the total field of view 5 deg x 322 deg. For half a spin (approx. 1.5 s) of the ASTRID spacecraft, almost all of space was covered with an angular resolution 2.5 deg x 25 deg. Less energetic neutrals of approx. 0.1 - 70 keV were converted on a graphite target into secondary particles which then were detected by a microchannel plate with 32 anodes. A fraction of primary neutrals was directly reflected towards the sensor. This technique provided the total ENA flux with an angular resolution 4.6 deg x 11.5 deg. The instrument weight is 3.13 kg. Successful operation of the instrument during the first 5 weeks of the mission provided the first ENA images of the ring current at low altitudes.},

abstract = {Seismo-electromagnetic phenomena refers to the electric and magnetic field perturbations that may be caused due to geophysical activities like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Due to the existence of such phenomena before earthquakes they may be regarded as short term precursors to earthquakes. Keeping in mind the in situ measurements for detection of such phenomena, the satellite based techniques are of great interest because they keep a constant track of the seismically active zones globally. With the objective of detecting the electromagnetic emissions in the ionosphere, the DEMETER satellite has been launched on 29th June 2004 from Baikonour in order to study the ionospheric perturbations associated with seismic activities. In this paper, we discuss some interesting results of electromagnetic emissions that are observed before a series of recent Indonesian earthquakes in the Jawa region with a major shock measuring 7.7 magnitude on Richter scale which occurred on 17 July 2006. The emissions have been observed in the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)/Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) range of electromagnetic spectra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) from the Earth's radiation belt has been observed on numerous occasions with detectors on the low-altitude S81-1/SEEP satellite. A sequence of seven LEP events on September 9, 1982, and eight events on October 20, 1982, are correlated on a one-to-one basis with one-hop whistlers at Palmer, Antarctica. The temporal profile within a LEP burst has a remarkable fine structure. It is shown to be associated with bunches of magnetically guided and focused 100-to-200 keV electrons that are repeatedly scattered by the atmosphere and bounce between the northern and southern hemispheres. The delay time between the lightning sferic and the arrival of the first electron bunch increases with increasing L as predicted by the first-order gyroresonance theory. The global distribution of strong LEP events observed with the SEEP payload correlates with lightning activity and shows a preferred distribution at 2{\textless}L{\textless}3. This L shell range corresponds to the slot region in the electron radiation belt. A single LEP burst (10-3ergs-1cm-2) in the slot region is estimated to deplete {\~{}}0.001{\%} of the particles in the region covered by the burst magnetic field lines. The evidence supports the production of structured LEP by ducted rather than nonducted whistlers. It is found that ducted whistlers can be an important pitch angle diffusion mechanism for 100-250 keV electrons in the 2{\textless}L{\textless}3 range although a number of uncertainties in the various parameters remain to be resolved. It is suggested that observations of LEP can be a new tool to measure the presence and transverse dimensions of plasmaspheric whistler mode ducts.},

abstract = {High-resolution measurements of subionospheric VLF signals at multiple sites are used as a new tool to assess the spatial distribution and occurrence of ionospheric disturbances associated with lightning-induced electron precipitation. Simultaneous observations in California, Saskatchewan, and Quebec of VLF signals from multiple sources allow the monitoring of event activity over a coarse grid covering the continental United States. Association of the observed VLF signal perturbations with lightning is often made on the basis of time correlation with prominent radio atmospherics. Simultaneous observations of individual events on subionospheric paths that “cross” one another are used to locate the disturbed ionospheric region(s). Absence of perturbations on nearby paths permits assessment of the spatial extent of the region with a varying degree of accuracy, depending on the distribution of signal paths. In one case distinctly different onset delays (with respect to causative discharges) consistent with predictions of whistler-particle scattering theory were found, and were interpreted as being due to two separate regions separated in L value by ∼0.4 L being excited in individual events. Occurrence statistics over the course of October 1987 exhibit generally higher levels of activity at the lower-latitude end of the 2 {\textless} L {\textless} 4 range, although it is difficult to separately assess the role of the source lightning distribution. Occurrence statistics of simultaneous events on crossing paths are consistent with the spatial extent of the disturbed ionospheric regions being less than a few hundred kilometers. The occurrence statistics also suggest that scattering from disturbances located at distances of {\textgreater}100 km off the great circle paths is not significant.},

abstract = {Previous results of plasmapause position surveys have been synthesized into a description of the underlying global distribution of plasmasphere-like or core plasma densities unique to a steady state magnetosphere. Under these steady conditions, the boundary between high- and low-density regions is taken to represent the boundary between diurnal near-corotation and large-scale circulation streamlines that traverse the entire magnetosphere. Results indicate a boundary that has a pronounced bulge in the dusk sector that is rotated westward and markedly reduced in size at increased levels of geomagnetic activity (and presumably magnetospheric convection). The derived profile is empirical confirmation of an underlying “tear drop” distribution of core plasma, which is valid only for prolonged steady conditions and is somewhat different from that associated with the simple superposition of sunward flow and corotation, both in its detailed shape and in its varying orientation. Variation away from the tear drop profile suggests that magnetospheric circulation departs from a uniform flow field, having a radial dependence with respect to the Earth that is qualitatively consistent with electrostatic shielding of the convection electric field and which is rotated westward at increased levels of geophysical activity.},

abstract = {Geospace phenomena such as the aurora, plasma motion, ionospheric currents and associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth's main magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the charged particles that comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena relative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common magnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done correctly.},

abstract = {Analysis of the DEMETER spacecraft particle data shows that energetic electron precipitation exhibits a seasonal dependence consistent with lighting-induced electron precipitation (LEP). Over the United States, energetic electron fluxes in the slot region (between L = 2 and 3) are significantly higher in the northern summer than in the winter, consistent with the seasonal variation of lightning activity in the Northern Hemisphere. The association of precipitating fluxes with lightning is explored using lightning location data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and VLF wave data on DEMETER. The increased precipitation of particles into the drift loss cone over the Northern Hemisphere in summer is consistent with expected pitch-angle scattering by lightning-generated whistler waves, indicating that lightning is a significant contributor to the loss of slot region electrons.},

abstract = {In this study we examine energetic electron precipitation fluxes driven by lightning, in order to determine the global distribution of energy deposited into the middle atmosphere. Previous studies using lightning-driven precipitation burst rates have estimated losses from the inner radiation belts. In order to confirm the reliability of those rates and the validity of the conclusions drawn from those studies, we have analyzed New Zealand data to test our global understanding of troposphere to magnetosphere coupling. We examine about 10000h of AbsPAL recordings made from 17 April 2003 through to 26 June 2004, and analyze subionospheric very-low frequency (VLF) perturbations observed on transmissions from VLF transmitters in Hawaii (NPM) and western Australia (NWC). These observations are compared with those previously reported from the Antarctic Peninsula. The perturbation rates observed in the New Zealand data are consistent with those predicted from the global distribution of the lightning sources, once the different experimental configurations are taken into account. Using lightning current distributions rather than VLF perturbation observations we revise previous estimates of typical precipitation bursts at L{\~{}}2.3 to a mean precipitation energy flux of {\~{}}110-3 ergs cm-2s-1. The precipitation of energetic electrons by these bursts in the range L=1.9-3.5 will lead to a mean rate of energy deposited into the atmosphere of 310-4 ergs cm-2min-1, spatially varying from a low of zero above some ocean regions to highs of {\~{}}3-610-3 ergs cm-2min-1 above North America and its conjugate region.},

abstract = {Observations of the relativistic electron flux increases during the first days of November, 2003 are compared to model simulations of two leading mechanisms for electron acceleration. It is demonstrated that radial diffusion driven by ULF waves cannot explain the formation of the new radiation belt in the slot region and instead predicts a decay of fluxes during the recovery phase of the October 31st storm. Compression of the plasmasphere during the main phases of the storm created preferential conditions for local acceleration during interactions with VLF chorus. Local acceleration of electrons at L = 3 is modelled with a 2-D pitch-angle, energy diffusion code. We show that the energy diffusion driven by whistler mode waves can explain the gradual build up of fluxes to energies exceeding 3 MeV in a new radiation belt which is formed in the slot region normally devoid of high energy electrons.},

abstract = {The origin of whistler mode radiation in the plasmasphere is examined from 3 years of plasma wave observations from the Dynamics Explorer and the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration spacecraft. These data are used to construct plasma wave intensity maps of whistler mode radiation in the plasmasphere. The highest average intensities of the radiation in the wave maps show source locations and/or sites of wave amplification. Each type of wave is classified on the basis of its magnetic latitude and longitude rather than any spectral feature. Equatorial electromagnetic (EM) emissions (∼30–330 Hz), plasmaspheric hiss (∼330 Hz to 3.3 kHz), chorus (∼2–6 kHz), and VLF transmitters (∼10–50 kHz) are the main types of waves that are clearly delineated in the plasma wave maps. Observations of the equatorial EM emissions show that the most intense region is on or near the magnetic equator in the afternoon sector and that during times of negative B z (interplanetary magnetic field) the maximum intensity moves from L values of 3 to {\textless}2. These observations are consistent with the origin of this emission being particle-wave interactions in or near the magnetic equator. Plasmaspheric hiss shows high intensity at high latitudes and low altitudes (L shells from 2 to 4) and in the magnetic equator with L values from 2 to 3 in the early afternoon sector. The longitudinal distribution of the hiss intensity (excluding the enhancement at the equator) is similar to the distribution of lightning: stronger over continents than over the ocean, stronger in the summer than in the winter, and stronger on the dayside than on the nightside. These observations strongly support lightning as the dominant source for plasmaspheric hiss, which, through particle-wave interactions, maintains the slot region in the radiation belts. The enhancement of hiss at the magnetic equator is consistent with particle-wave interactions. The chorus emissions are most intense on the morningside as previously reported. At frequencies from ∼10 to ∼50 kHz, VLF transmitters dominate the spectrum. The maximum intensity of the VLF transmitters is in the late evening or early morning with enhancements all along L shells from 1.8 to 3.},

abstract = {The Van Allen radiation belts are two regions encircling the Earth in which energetic charged particles are trapped inside the Earth's magnetic field. Their properties vary according to solar activity and they represent a hazard to satellites and humans in space. An important challenge has been to explain how the charged particles within these belts are accelerated to very high energies of several million electron volts. Here we show, on the basis of the analysis of a rare event where the outer radiation belt was depleted and then re-formed closer to the Earth, that the long established theory of acceleration by radial diffusion is inadequate; the electrons are accelerated more effectively by electromagnetic waves at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Wave acceleration can increase the electron flux by more than three orders of magnitude over the observed timescale of one to two days, more than sufficient to explain the new radiation belt. Wave acceleration could also be important for Jupiter, Saturn and other astrophysical objects with magnetic fields.},

abstract = {The flux of relativistic electrons in the Earth's radiation belts is highly variable and can change by orders of magnitude on timescales of a few hours. Understanding the drivers for these changes is important as energetic electrons can damage satellites. We present results from a new code, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Radiation Belt model, which solves a 3-D Fokker-Planck equation, following a similar approach to the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) code, incorporating the effects of radial diffusion, wave-particle interactions, and collisions. Whistler mode chorus waves, plasmaspheric hiss, and lightning-generated whistlers (LGW) are modeled using new diffusion coefficients, calculated by the Pitch Angle and Energy Diffusion of Ions and Electrons (PADIE) code, with new wave models based on satellite data that have been parameterized by both the AE and Kp indices. The model for plasmaspheric hiss and LGW includes variation in the wave-normal angle distribution of the waves with latitude. Simulations of 100 days from the CRRES mission demonstrate that the inclusion of chorus waves in the model is needed to reproduce the observed increase in MeV flux during disturbed conditions. The model reproduces the variation of the radiation belts best when AE, rather than Kp, is used to determine the diffusion rates. Losses due to plasmaspheric hiss depend critically on the the wave-normal angle distribution; a model where the peak of the wave-normal angle distribution depends on latitude best reproduces the observed decay rates. Higher frequency waves (∼1-2 kHz) only make a significant contribution to losses for L{\^{a}}̂ -{\textless}3 and the highest frequencies (2-5 kHz), representing LGW, have a limited effect on MeV electrons for 2{\textless}L{\^{a}}̂ -{\textless}5.5.

abstract = {A test particle simulation model (Inan et al., 1982) of the gyroresonance wave-particle interaction in the magnetosphere is extended to study the transient particle precipitation fluxes induced by various coherent VLF waves with slowly varying frequency propagating along the earth's magnetic field lines. For moderate wave intensities (Bw ≤ 10 pT at L = 4) a comparison between input signals with linearly rising and falling frequencies shows that they induce the same amount of precipitated particle energy deposition. However, when the wave growth near the principal interaction region is considered, the precipitation induced by a riser is considerably higher than that induced by a faller. The effect of the frequency-time slope (df/dt) of the input signal on the induced precipitation energy flux is found to be small. Our results indicate, however, that the precipitation energy flux depends strongly on the falloff in energy of the trapped particle distribution function. The model is applied for computing the transient precipitation energy fluxes induced by a triggered rising emission, a hooklike signal and a one-hop whistler. The total precipitated energy deposition for these various signals is found to be comparable to that induced by a linear ramp having the same input wave energy density.},

Then, as the satellite passed near one of the receiving stations, a radio command from the ground caused these data to be read out. A preliminary study of the data obtained from 1958 a and several interrogations of 1958 y has been carried out, with the following results},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) subsystem for the Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) CubeSat. The GPS subsystem provides accurate temporal and spatial information necessary to satisfy the science objectives of the RAX mission. There are many challenges in the successful design and implementation of a GPS subsystem for a CubeSat-based mission, including power, size, mass, and financial constraints. This paper presents an approach for selecting and testing the individual and integrated GPS subsystem components, including the receiver, antenna, low noise amplifier, and supporting circuitry. The procedures to numerically evaluate the GPS link budget and test the subsystem components at various stages of system integration are described. Performance results for simulated tests in the terrestrial and orbital environments are provided, including start-up times, carrier-to-noise ratios, and orbital position accuracy. Preliminary on-orbit GPS results from the RAX-1 and RAX-2 spacecraft are presented to validate the design process and pre-flight simulations. Overall, this paper provides a systematic approach to aid future satellite designers in implementing and verifying GPS subsystems for resource-constrained small satellites. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAA Published by Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Horner1954,
abstract = {In recent years, increasing importance has been attached to the use of radio direction-finders for the location of thunderstorms. A large number of stations for this purpose are now in operation, and for the planning of further networks it is necessary to assess the accuracy to which storms may at present be located, and to delimit the areas in which location is satisfactory with the existing networks. An investigation of the accuracy of the United Kingdom network of twin-channel cathode-ray direction-finders, operating at frequencies near 10 kc/s, has shown that instrumental errors other than polarization errors are small, but that at particular stations, errors of several degrees have been caused by the hilly nature of the terrain and by buried cables. When the equipment is on a level site, free from obstructions, polarization errors are likely to be the main limitation to accuracy, particularly at distances of a few hundred kilometres and at night. Maximum errors of 2? or 3? may be expected in summer day-time and rather more in winter day-time. The magnitudes of polarization errors at night are not accurately known. Over a limited range of distance, around 400km, observations on continuous-wave stations exhibit, at times, r.m.s. errors of more than 20?, but there is evidence that errors of this magnitude do not normally occur with atmospherics. At distances greater than 1 000km, polarization errors may be expected to be no greater than 2? or 3?, even at night. At these distances there are also significant errors caused by interference between the atmospheric under observation and others arriving almost simultaneously. Although knowledge of the errors is far from complete, preliminary estimates of their magnitudes have been made and an estimate of the accuracy of storm location has been derived. It is not possible to express the potential accuracy in simple terms, since it depends not only on the bearing errors, the spacing of the stations and the distance of the - storm, but also on the number of observations made and the manner in which they are interpreted. As an indication of the order of magnitude, it is estimated that with the present network and observation technique the probable error in position of a storm centre at a distance of 1 000km is about 20km by summer day, 50km by winter day and 100km by night. These preliminary estimates, particularly that for night-time conditions, must be regarded as approximate because knowledge of the bearing errors is still lacking in some important respects. In particular, a more complete knowledge is required of their amplitude distribution and of the degree of correlation, if any, between polarization errors at the different stations. The types of error discussed are liable to occur with all atmospherics direction-finders in current use; polarization errors, in particular, may be expected with any instrument with an aerial system incorporating either a single rotating loop or a pair of fixed crossed-loops.},

abstract = {Lightning discharges generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak component in the very low frequency (VLF; 3–30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (≤6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1–4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between ∼40 and 60{\%} is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

Depending on the ratio of drift speed to magnetic field strength, the drift velocity can be determined either from the two emission directions that cause the electrons to gyrate back to detectors placed some distance from the emitting guns, or from measurements of the time of flight of the electrons. As a by-product of the time-of-flight measurements, the magnetic field strength is also determined. The paper describes strengths and weaknesses of the method as well as technical constraints.},

A similar analysis for the midnight satellite data yields an annual lightning frequency of 96 s-1 with average values of 110 s-1 in the northern summer and 79 s-1 in the southern summer.

abstract = {Analysis of the functional approximations used to transform between geographic and Altitude-Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) coordinates reveals that errors of {\textgreater}50 km can occur in the auroral and polar regions. These errors are the result of efforts to better approximate AACGM coordinates near the magnetic equator and the South Atlantic Anomaly. In these regions AACGM coordinates are not defined and alternate coordinates have been used. This augmentation and emphasis on the solution in regions near the equator result in spherical harmonic approximating functions that are less accurate than need be in the auroral and polar regions. In response, a new set of spherical harmonic coefficients have been derived that better represent AACGM coordinates in these regions. These new AACGM coefficients are limited to below 2000 km in altitude in order to ensure accuracy. For altitudes above 2000 km, a magnetic field-line tracing solution is recommended. A software package developed to take advantage of the new AACGM coefficients provides the capability of tracing magnetic field lines at any altitude, for improved accuracy. In addition, linear interpolation between 5 year epochs is used to produce coordinates that vary smoothly over the entire period from 1965 to present. The intent of this work is to provide a more accurate procedure for determining AACGM coordinates in the auroral and polar regions for the study of magnetospheric and ionospheric processes.},

abstract = {Magnetic pulsations in the Pc1{\&}{\#}8211;Pc2 frequency range (0.1{\&}{\#}8211;5 Hz) are often observed on the ground and in the Earth's magnetosphere during the aftermath of geomagnetic storms. Numerous studies have suggested that they may play a role in reducing the fluxes of energetic ions in the ring current; more recent studies suggest they may interact parasitically with radiation belt electrons as well. We report here on observations during 2005 from search coil magnetometers and riometers installed at three Antarctic stations, Halley ({\&}{\#}8722;61.84� magnetic latitude, MLAT), South Pole ({\&}{\#}8722;74.18� MLAT), and McMurdo ({\&}{\#}8722;79.96� MLAT), and from energetic ion detectors on the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environment Satellites (POES). A superposed epoch analysis based on 13 magnetic storms between April and September 2005 as well as case studies confirm several earlier studies that show that narrowband Pc1{\&}{\#}8211;Pc2 waves are rarely if ever observed on the ground during the main and early recovery phases of magnetic storms. However, intense broadband Pi1{\&}{\#}8211;Pi2 ULF noise, accompanied by strong riometer absorption signatures, does occur during these times. As storm recovery progresses, the occurrence of Pc1{\&}{\#}8211;Pc2 waves increases, at first in the daytime and especially afternoon sectors but at essentially all local times later in the recovery phase (typically by days 3 or 4). During the early storm recovery phase the propagation of Pc1{\&}{\#}8211;Pc2 waves through the ionospheric waveguide to higher latitudes was more severely attenuated. These observations are consistent with suggestions that Pc1{\&}{\#}8211;Pc2 waves occurring during the early recovery phase of magnetic storms are generated in association with plasmaspheric plumes in the noon-to-dusk sector, and these observations provide additional evidence that the propagation of waves to ground stations is inhibited during the early phases of such storms. Analysis of 30- to 250-keV proton data from four POES satellites during the 24{\&}{\#}8211;27 August and 18{\&}{\#}8211;19 July 2005 storm intervals showed that the location of the inner edge of the ring current matched well with the plasmapause model of O'Brien and Moldwin (2003). However, the POES data showed no evidence of the consequences of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (localized proton precipitation) during main and early recovery phase. During later stages of the recovery phase, when such precipitation was observed, it was coincident with intense wave events at Halley, and it occurred at L shells near or up to 1 R E outside the modeled plasmapause but well equatorward of the isotropy boundary.},

It is also often necessary to differentiate several geophysical parameters between horizontal and vertical gradients unambiguously. The availability of multiple tethered satellites or sensors, so-called "pearls-on-a-string," may make the necessary measurements practical. In this report we provide two examples of scientific questions which could benefit from such measurements (1) high-latitude magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling; and, (2) plasma structure impact on large and small-scale electrodynamics.

abstract = {Sudden changes in the amplitude of long-distance subionospheric VLF transmissions have been found at night in association with whistlers. Both increases and decreases in signal strength have been observed, depending on signal frequency and orientation Of the receiving antenna. Sample observations at Eights Station in Antarctica of station NSS (Annapolis, Maryland) on 22.3 kHz showed increases in signal strength that averaged 3 db, with rise times of about 2 sec and durations of about 30 sec. Coincident with every rise was a mid- latitude (L {\~{}} 2.5) whistler originating in the northern hemisphere. To explain this association, it is suggested that the whistler dumps energetic (30-300 kev) electrons into the D region. The resulting ionization then alters the properties of the earth-ionosphere wave guide. The mechanism of precipitation is thought to be pitch angle scattering of trapped electrons that resonate with the magnetic field of the whistler wave near the magnetic equator.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents a study of several aspects of the resonant interaction be- tween energetic radiation-belt electrons and lightning generated, magnetospherically- re°ecting (MR) whistler mode waves in the inner magnetosphere. We initially develop a ¯rst-order model to estimate the L-shell dependence of the precipitation °ux of energetic electrons driven by MR whistlers injected at 25±, 35±, and 45± geomagnetic latitude, assuming ¯rst a horizontally strati¯ed ionosphere and then an ionosphere containing realistic horizontal density gradients as given by the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. Results indicate that in the region 1:4 {\textless} L {\textless} 1:62, a narrow (in L-shell extent) peak in the precipitation signature can result due to the focusing of the whistler wave packet on the ¯rst magnetospheric traverse. A wide bulge is formed in the region L{\textgreater}1:8 due to subsequent $\backslash$hops" of the whistler wave energy, and the tendency of the whistler to move slowly outward in L with each hop. By examining the °ux of electrons with energy {\textgreater}150 keV, we obtain excellent agreement with measurements of °ux enhancements observed in the drift loss-cone, aboard the SAMPEX satellite. We then turn our attention to the detailed calculation of the frequency-time (f¡ t) characteristics and power of an MR whistler generated by a single cloud-ground discharge at a given latitude, as it would appear on a satellite at any point in the magnetosphere. By developing an extensive ray tracing and interpolation technique, we simulate a whistler observed aboard the OGO 1 satellite to ¯nd excellent agreement between theory and measurement. We then simulate the f¡t spectra that would be produced by lightning injection latitudes of 25±, 35±, 45± and 55± geomagnetic latitude, and observed on the geomagnetic equator at L = 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4. We vary the cold iv plasma density distribution through which the whistler wave propagates, and obtain MR whistler signatures that clearly re°ect the properties of the medium traversed by the wave. Using the formulation described above, we compute the f ¡t spectra of an MR whistler at 1± latitude bins along a given ¯eld line, thus estimating the wave structure as a function of frequency and time. By treating the pitch-angle scattering in each latitude bin as being incoherent with respect to that produced in any other latitude bin, we calculate the precipitated °ux of energetic electrons as a function of time, at every latitude bin on the ¯eld-line, including gyro-harmonic resonance interactions of order +5 to ¡5, as well as the zero order or Landau resonance. We use a realistic AE8 °ux distribution for the trapped °ux composing the radiation belts, with a sinusoidal pitch-angle distribution tending to zero at the loss-cone. Results indicate that MR whistler-induced precipitation episodes can last for tens of seconds and moves to higher L-shells (and hence latitudes) on both short (0.1 sec) and long (10 sec) timescales, covering a geographic region measuring hundreds of kilometers. We conclude that the °ux of precipitating, energetic, radiation belt electrons driven by lightning generated magnetospherically re°ecting whistler waves is con- sistently detectable in the drift loss cone, and produces unique signatures which can be detected using either satellite-borne instruments or ground-based techniques.},

abstract = {The flux of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt can vary by several orders of magnitude over time scales less than a day, in response to changes in properties of the solar wind instigated by solar activity. Variability in the radiation belts is due to an imbalance between the dominant source and loss processes, caused by a violation of one or more of the adiabatic invariants. For radiation belt electrons, non‐adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understand- ing and global modeling of such wave‐particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

abstract = {A recently extended test particle computer model of the gyroresonance wave-particle interaction in the magnetosphere is applied to previously reported cases of observed correlations between whistler mode waves and ionospheric responses to particle precipitation. Three different ionospheric effects, X ray bursts, photoemissions, and D region perturbations, all correlated with VLF waves and believed to be caused by precipitated particles, are considered. The precipitation flux level, the pulse shape, and the associated time delays are computed for the parameters relevant to each case and are compared with values deduced from the data. The results demonstrate that the existing theoretical model can be useful for interpreting experimental results of this kind. Furthermore, the model results and observations, used together, provide a basis for additional diagnostics of the various parameters of the cold and energetic particle distributions in the magnetosphere. For example, when applied to the observed photoemission case (Helliwell et al., 1980) the model results imply that the trapped energetic particle distribution function at the time could be modeled as proportional to E {\&}minus;n {\&}sol;2 with n {\&}sime; 3.5 to 6, where E is the particle energy.},

abstract = {The interaction of magnetized, relativistic test particles with a monochromatic electromagnetic wave is analyzed, taking into account the passage through cyclotron resonance in the spatially varying background magnetic field in slab geometry. A resonance-averaged Hamiltonian is used to delineate two distinct regimes. In both cases, termed “adiabatic” and “nonadiabatic,” the first adiabatic invariant of the particle is broken during a resonant interaction, leading to change in energy and pitch angle. The adiabatic case is characterized by a limited range of resonant phase and a well-defined value of the change of the invariant. In the nonadiabatic case the phase at resonance ranges over 0 to 2$\pi$, and only the magnitude of the change of the invariant is determined; a phase factor gives the invariant change an effectively random sign. The appropriate regime is determined by a ratio of timescales which, in turn, depends on the particle and wave properties: adiabaticity is favored by large wave amplitudes and small parallel gradients of the geomagnetic field Bo. The long-term consequences of the two regimes are explored with a Monte Carlo simulation in the form of an iterated mapping. In a particular example, while some particles pitch angle scatter into the loss cone, energy is also removed from the distribution by particles in the adiabatic regime decaying in energy owing to repeated resonant interactions with the wave. Important potential magnetospheric applications include flux levels in the inner radiation belts, observations of “pancake” pitch angle distributions, and energization of storm time “killer” electrons.},

abstract = {A theory is presented of the nonlinear gyroresonance interaction that takes place in the magnetosphere between energetic electrons and coherent VLF waves propagating in the whistler mode at an arbitrary angle psi with respect to the earth's magnetic field B-sub-0. Particularly examined is the phase trapping (PT) mechanism believed to be responsible for the generation of VLF emissions. It is concluded that near the magnetic equatorial plane gradients of psi may play a very important part in the PT process for nonducted waves. Predictions of a higher threshold value for PT for nonducted waves generally agree with experimental data concerning VLF emission triggering by nonducted waves.},

abstract = {The present investigation has the objective to study the precipitation of energetic electrons into the ionosphere due to the interaction of these particles with short-duration VLF waves in the magnetosphere. The physics of the interaction is considered, taking into account the wave structure, the energetic particle distribution, wave-particle interaction, and the computation of the precipitated flux versus time. The obtained formulation is applied to various different magnetospheric conditions. Attention is also given to peak flux and total deposited energy. The results of the investigation demonstrate the role of the energetic particle distribution function, the normalized wave frequency, the L value of the path of propagation, the cold plasma density, and the wave intensity. The precipitated energy flux that would be observed at 1000-km altitude is presented as a function of time relative to the injection of the wave pulse at the same point.},

abstract = {The Earth's radiation belts—also known as theVan Allen belts1 — contain high-energy electrons trapped on magnetic field lines2,3 . The centre of the outer belt is usually 20,000–25,000km from Earth. The region between the belts is normally devoid of particles2–4 , and is accordingly favoured as a location for space- craft operation because of the benign environment5 . Here we report that the outer Van Allen belt was compressed dramatically by a solar stormknown as the ‘Hallowe'en storm' of 2003. From 1 to 10 November, the outer belt had its centre only ,10,000km from Earth's equatorial surface, and the plasmasphere was similarly displaced inwards. The region between the belts became the location of high particle radiation intensity. This remarkable deformation of the entire magnetosphere implies surprisingly powerful acceleration and loss processes deep within the magnetosphere.},

abstract = {We use the methodology presented in a companion paper to calculate the temporal and spatial precipitation signatures of energetic radiation-belt electrons due to pitch-angle scattering by magnetospherically reflecting (MR) whistler waves generated by lightning discharges at geomagnetic source latitudes of $\lambda$s = 25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°. We show precipitated energy and number fluxes, as well as average precipitated energy as a function of time and L-shell for all four $\lambda$s cases, and then extrapolate the results of the $\lambda$s = 35° case in longitude to produce a time-sequence of geographic ‘hot spots' which are affected by the MR whistler induced electron precipitation. We then discuss the total precipitation in both hemispheres due to the various $\lambda$s cases. Our major findings are that the precipitation region moves to higher L-shells as a function of time, on short (0.1 sec, at the start of the event) and long (10 sec) timescales, corresponding to the first hop of the wave, and the MR portion of the whistler wave, respectively. There is also structure within the long-timescale precipitation on the order of ∼1 sec, reflecting the periodic MR of the underlying whistler wave. As $\lambda$s increases, an additional precipitated flux signature which is more incoherent and discontinuous, begins to form at higher L-shells and later times, due to MR whistler wave reflections from the plasmapause. At lower L-shells, a pronounced maximum occurs in the number flux of ∼1 keV electrons at L ∼ 2–3 due to the Landau resonance. The geographic hot spot affected by the precipitation can split into two separate regions per hemisphere, and occur simultaneously in both hemispheres so that up to four distinct precipitation hot spots can occur on the Earth at any instant, driven by a single lightning discharge. We also discuss potential sources of error, and comparison to related modeling efforts, and to observations using a either satellite-borne instruments or ground-based techniques.},

abstract = {Observations of lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) events at three geographic regions show characteristics which systematically vary with both longitude and hemisphere. These observations are quantitatively interpreted using a novel atmospheric interaction model designed to predict the characteristics of LEP events at any longitude and midlatitude L-shell by accounting for the effects of precipitating electrons which are backscattered from the atmosphere. The model of atmospheric backscatter (ABS) calculates atmospheric backscatter responses for individual monoenergetic electron beams with a single incident pitch angle using a Monte Carlo model of atmospheric interactions. The ABS model also includes an asymmetric (non-ideal dipole) geomagnetic field model in calculations of the pitch angle of backscattered electrons entering the conjugate hemisphere. Using a realistic distribution of precipitating electrons, the results of this backscatter calculation at three separate longitudes are compared with VLF remote sensing data collected on nearly north-south great circle paths (GCPs). Results predicted by the model and confirmed by data indicate that all four primary LEP characteristics exhibit longitudinal and hemispheric dependence which can be explained in terms of precipitating electrons backscattered from the atmosphere. By combining these effects with previously calculated radiation belt electron loss rates due to lightning at a single location it is possible to estimate the global loss of radiation belt electrons due to lightning.},

The Myriade objective was to benefit from the miniaturization of the technologies to develop a product with a reduced size, weight and cost able to implement either scientific missions, demonstrators or operational applications in different areas: earth observation, astronomy, fundamental physics or telecommunications, within limited financial budget. The Demeter satellite was launched in end of June 2004, from Baikonour, aboard a Dnepr launcher, on a sun synchronous orbit at 710 km altitude. Its main scientific objectives are the detection and characterization of ionosphere electrical and magnetic disturbances in connection with a seismic activity. The scientific payload has been built by French scientific institutes (LPCE, CESR, CETP) involved in external and internal geophysics and by SSD/ESTEC (ESA). It is composed of several electrical and magnetic sensors, an ion spectrometer, an energetic particle analyzer and a Langmuir probe. The Demeter platform is designed in order to offer a high level of performances in terms of power, attitude and orbit control, data storage and transmission, flexibility. For example the large amount of scientific data is transmitted to the ground station with a high data rate telemetry link in X band. This paper describes the Demeter satellite and ground segment. It focuses on the specific design adaptations of the Myriade product for Demeter and it presents the preliminary in orbit platform performances. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent analysis of satellite data obtained during the 9 October 2012 geomagnetic storm identified the development of peaks in electron phase space density, which are compelling evidence for local electron acceleration in the heart of the outer radiation belt, but are inconsistent with acceleration by inward radial diffusive transport. However, the precise physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration on 9 October was not identified. Previous modelling has indicated that a magnetospheric electromagnetic emission known as chorus could be a potential candidate for local electron acceleration, but a definitive resolution of the importance of chorus for radiation-belt acceleration was not possible because of limitations in the energy range and resolution of previous electron observations and the lack of a dynamic global wave model. Here we report high-resolution electron observations obtained during the 9 October storm and demonstrate, using a two-dimensional simulation performed with a recently developed time-varying data-driven model, that chorus scattering explains the temporal evolution of both the energy and angular distribution of the observed relativistic electron flux increase. Our detailed modelling demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of wave acceleration in the Earth's outer radiation belt, and the results presented have potential application to Jupiter, Saturn and other magnetized astrophysical objects.},

abstract = {Electric field spectrum measurements from the plasma wave instrument on the Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft are used to study the local electron density at high altitudes in the northern polar cap region. The electron density is determined from the upper cutoff of whistler mode radiation at the electron plasma frequency. Median density values over the polar cap at L greater than 10 are found to vary from 35.2±8.5 cm−3 at 2.1 RE to 0.99±0.51 cm−3 at 4.66 RE. The steady state radial outflow model is examined for consistency with the observed density profile. A power law fit to the radial variation of the electron density yields an exponent of −3.85±0.32, which for the radial outflow model implies a flow velocity increasing nearly linearly with increasing radial distance. Comparison of the observed electron densities with theoretical polar wind densities yields consistent results up to 2.8 RE. A comparison of the observed electron densities with low-altitude density profiles from the Alouette II and ISIS 1 spacecraft illustrate transitions in the slope of the profile at 1.16 RE and between 1.55 and 2.0 RE. The changes in the density profile suggest that changes occur in the basic radial transport processes at these altitudes.},

abstract = {In the present paper, phase space density functions of the form f(v) = A  N /v  n  are fitted to statistical distributions of suprathermal electron fluxes (E = 0.213–16.5 keV) from the CRRES satellite, parameterized by L-shell, Magnetic Local Time (MLT), and geomagnetic activity. The fitted distributions are used in conjunction with ray tracing to calculate the Landau damping rates of an ensemble of rays representing whistler-mode chorus waves. The modeled propagation characteristics are compared with observations of chorus wave power from the CRRES satellite, as a function of L-shell, MLT, and magnetic latitude, in various frequency bands, and under various geomagnetic conditions. It is shown that the model results are remarkably consistent with many aspects of the observed wave distributions, including frequency, L-shell, MLT, and latitudinal dependence. In addition, the MLT distribution of wave power becomes characteristically asymmetric during active geomagnetic conditions, with small propagation lengths on the nightside which increase with MLT and maximize on the dayside. This asymmetry is shown to be directly related to the dynamics of the Landau resonant suprathermal electrons which drift around the Earth whilst undergoing scattering and loss due to a variety of plasma waves. Consequently, the suprathermal electrons play an important role in radiation belt dynamics, by controlling the distribution of chorus, which in turn contributes to the acceleration and loss of relativistic electrons in the recovery phase of storms.},

IRI by charter and design is an empirical model based on a wide range of ground and space data. It describes monthly averages of ionospheric densities and temperatures in the altitude range 50-1500 km in the non-auroral ionosphere. Since its inception in 1969 the IRI model has been steadily improved with newer data and with better mathematical descriptions of global and temporal variation patterns. A large number of independent studies have validated the IRI model in comparisons with direct and indirect ionospheric measurements not used in the model development. A comparison with IRI is often one of the first science tasks by an ionospheric satellite or rocket team. This paper describes the latest version of the IRI model, IRI-2007, explaining the most important changes that are being introduced with this version. These include: (1) two new options for the topside electron density, (2) a new model for the topside ion composition, (3) the first-time inclusion of a model for the spread F occurrence probability, (4) a NeuralNet model for auroral E-region electron densities, (5) a model for the plasmaspheric electron temperature, and (6) the latest International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for the computation of magnetic coordinates including their changes due to the secular variation of the magnetic field. ?? 2008 COSPAR.},

abstract = {A new combined ray tracing and test particle formulation is presented which calculates the spatiotemporal electron precipitation flux signatures at ionospheric altitudes induced by obliquely propagating lightning-generated whistler waves. The formulation accounts for the variation in wave characteristics (frequency-time dispersion, wave normal angle, and power density) as the whistler generated by an individual lightning discharge propagates through vast volumes of the magnetosphere in the absence of field-aligned cold plasma density enhancements, and calculates the detailed gyroresonance scattering of trapped energetic electrons into the atmospheric loss cone over a broad range of field lines (L shells) to determine the precipitation flux over extensive ionospheric regions. Results show that peak precipitation flux patches (hotspots) several tens of degrees of latitude and longitude in size develop at locations ∼7° to ∼20° poleward of the discharge as a consequence of propagation paths which convey wave energy from lower to higher L shells. For oblique whistler intensities matching satellite observations (10 to 30 pT) peak flux levels of several milli-ergs cm−2 s−1 are indicated, arriving as early as ∼ 1/4 s and lasting ∼1/2 s at lower observing latitudes (e.g., ∼32° for North American longitudes), while being delayed to ∼l s or more and lasting up to ∼2 s at higher latitudes (∼47°), creating a sense of poleward hotspot motion. Summary profiles integrated over time, latitude and L shell suggest that lightning-generated oblique whistler-induced electron precipitation deposits appreciable energy to the upper atmosphere at midlatitudes and contributes significantly to the loss of energetic ({\textgreater}100 keV) radiation belt electrons, particularly over 2.2 ≤ L ≤ 3.5 where the slot region forms.},
