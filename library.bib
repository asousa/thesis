@article{Massey1998,
abstract = {In this book, Doreen Massey makes an impassioned argument for revitalising our imagination of space. She takes on some well-established assumptions from philosophy, and some familiar ways of characterising the twenty-first century world, and shows how they restrain our understanding of both the challenge and the potential of space. The way we think about space matters. It inflects our understandings of the world, our attitudes to others, our politics. It affects, for instance, the way we understand globalisation, the way we approach cities, the way we develop, and practice, a sense of place. If time is the dimension of change then space is the dimension of the social: the contemporaneous co-existence of others. That is its challenge, and one that has been persistently evaded. For Space pursues its argument through philosophical and theoretical engagement, and through telling personal and political reflection. Doreen Massey asks questions such as how best to characterise these so-called spatial times, how it is that implicit spatial assumptions inflect our politics, and how we might develop a responsibility for place beyond place.},

The data collected by 1958 y were also telemetered con- tinuously. In addition, a small magnetic tape recorder stored the data obtained during each entire orbit. Then, as the satellite passed near one of the receiving stations, a radio command from the ground caused these data to be read out. A preliminary study of the data obtained from 1958 a and several interrogations of 1958 y has been carried out, with the following results},

@article{Said2010a,
abstract = {Lightning discharges generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak component in the very low frequency (VLF; 3–30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (≤6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1–4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between ∼40 and 60{\%} is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

@article{Bortnik2007,
abstract = {In the present paper, phase space density functions of the form f(v) = A  N /v  n  are fitted to statistical distributions of suprathermal electron fluxes (E = 0.213–16.5 keV) from the CRRES satellite, parameterized by L-shell, Magnetic Local Time (MLT), and geomagnetic activity. The fitted distributions are used in conjunction with ray tracing to calculate the Landau damping rates of an ensemble of rays representing whistler-mode chorus waves. The modeled propagation characteristics are compared with observations of chorus wave power from the CRRES satellite, as a function of L-shell, MLT, and magnetic latitude, in various frequency bands, and under various geomagnetic conditions. It is shown that the model results are remarkably consistent with many aspects of the observed wave distributions, including frequency, L-shell, MLT, and latitudinal dependence. In addition, the MLT distribution of wave power becomes characteristically asymmetric during active geomagnetic conditions, with small propagation lengths on the nightside which increase with MLT and maximize on the dayside. This asymmetry is shown to be directly related to the dynamics of the Landau resonant suprathermal electrons which drift around the Earth whilst undergoing scattering and loss due to a variety of plasma waves. Consequently, the suprathermal electrons play an important role in radiation belt dynamics, by controlling the distribution of chorus, which in turn contributes to the acceleration and loss of relativistic electrons in the recovery phase of storms.},

abstract = {The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), a joint project of URSI and COSPAR, is the de facto international standard for the climatological specification of ionospheric parameters and as such it is currently undergoing registration as Technical Specification (TS) of the International Standardization Organization (ISO). IRI by charter and design is an empirical model based on a wide range of ground and space data. It describes monthly averages of ionospheric densities and temperatures in the altitude range 50-1500 km in the non-auroral ionosphere. Since its inception in 1969 the IRI model has been steadily improved with newer data and with better mathematical descriptions of global and temporal variation patterns. A large number of independent studies have validated the IRI model in comparisons with direct and indirect ionospheric measurements not used in the model development. A comparison with IRI is often one of the first science tasks by an ionospheric satellite or rocket team. This paper describes the latest version of the IRI model, IRI-2007, explaining the most important changes that are being introduced with this version. These include: (1) two new options for the topside electron density, (2) a new model for the topside ion composition, (3) the first-time inclusion of a model for the spread F occurrence probability, (4) a NeuralNet model for auroral E-region electron densities, (5) a model for the plasmaspheric electron temperature, and (6) the latest International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for the computation of magnetic coordinates including their changes due to the secular variation of the magnetic field. ?? 2008 COSPAR.},

Particularly examined is the phase trapping (PT) mechanism believed to be responsible for the generation of VLF emissions. It is concluded that near the magnetic equatorial plane gradients of psi may play a very important part in the PT process for nonducted waves. Predictions of a higher threshold value for PT for nonducted waves generally agree with experimental data concerning VLF emission triggering by nonducted waves.},

@article{Rodger2010,
abstract = {In this study we examine energetic electron precipitation fluxes driven by lightning, in order to determine the global distribution of energy deposited into the middle atmosphere. Previous studies using lightning-driven precipitation burst rates have estimated losses from the inner radiation belts. In order to confirm the reliability of those rates and the validity of the conclusions drawn from those studies, we have analyzed New Zealand data to test our global understanding of troposphere to magnetosphere coupling. We examine about 10000h of AbsPAL recordings made from 17 April 2003 through to 26 June 2004, and analyze subionospheric very-low frequency (VLF) perturbations observed on transmissions from VLF transmitters in Hawaii (NPM) and western Australia (NWC). These observations are compared with those previously reported from the Antarctic Peninsula. The perturbation rates observed in the New Zealand data are consistent with those predicted from the global distribution of the lightning sources, once the different experimental configurations are taken into account. Using lightning current distributions rather than VLF perturbation observations we revise previous estimates of typical precipitation bursts at L{\~{}}2.3 to a mean precipitation energy flux of {\~{}}110-3 ergs cm-2s-1. The precipitation of energetic electrons by these bursts in the range L=1.9-3.5 will lead to a mean rate of energy deposited into the atmosphere of 310-4 ergs cm-2min-1, spatially varying from a low of zero above some ocean regions to highs of {\~{}}3-610-3 ergs cm-2min-1 above North America and its conjugate region.},

A variety of important propagation characteristics are revealed associated with azimuthal density gradients and a plasmaspheric plume. Specifically, whistler mode chorus originating from a broad region on the dayside can propagate into the plasmasphere. After entry into the plasmasphere, waves can propagate eastward in MLT and merge to form hiss. This explains how chorus generated on the dayside can contribute to plasmaspheric hiss in the dusk sector. A subset of waves entering the plasmasphere can even propagate globally onto the nightside.

abstract = {The flux of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt can vary by several orders of magnitude over time scales less than a day, in response to changes in properties of the solar wind instigated by solar activity. Variability in the radiation belts is due to an imbalance between the dominant source and loss processes, caused by a violation of one or more of the adiabatic invariants. For radiation belt electrons, non‐adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understand- ing and global modeling of such wave‐particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

abstract = {We use the methodology presented in a companion paper to calculate the temporal and spatial precipitation signatures of energetic radiation-belt electrons due to pitch-angle scattering by magnetospherically reflecting (MR) whistler waves generated by lightning discharges at geomagnetic source latitudes of $\lambda$s = 25°, 35°, 45°, and 55°. We show precipitated energy and number fluxes, as well as average precipitated energy as a function of time and L-shell for all four $\lambda$s cases, and then extrapolate the results of the $\lambda$s = 35° case in longitude to produce a time-sequence of geographic ‘hot spots' which are affected by the MR whistler induced electron precipitation. We then discuss the total precipitation in both hemispheres due to the various $\lambda$s cases. Our major findings are that the precipitation region moves to higher L-shells as a function of time, on short (0.1 sec, at the start of the event) and long (10 sec) timescales, corresponding to the first hop of the wave, and the MR portion of the whistler wave, respectively. There is also structure within the long-timescale precipitation on the order of ∼1 sec, reflecting the periodic MR of the underlying whistler wave. As $\lambda$s increases, an additional precipitated flux signature which is more incoherent and discontinuous, begins to form at higher L-shells and later times, due to MR whistler wave reflections from the plasmapause. At lower L-shells, a pronounced maximum occurs in the number flux of ∼1 keV electrons at L ∼ 2–3 due to the Landau resonance. The geographic hot spot affected by the precipitation can split into two separate regions per hemisphere, and occur simultaneously in both hemispheres so that up to four distinct precipitation hot spots can occur on the Earth at any instant, driven by a single lightning discharge. We also discuss potential sources of error, and comparison to related modeling efforts, and to observations using a either satellite-borne instruments or ground-based techniques.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Energetic particle precipitation couples the solar wind to the Earth's atmosphere and indirectly to Earth's climate. Ionisation and dissociation increases, due to particle precipitation, create odd nitrogen (NOx) and odd hydrogen (HOX) in the upper atmosphere, which can affect ozone chemistry. The long-lived NOx can be transported downwards into the stratosphere, particularly during the polar winter. Thus, the impact of NOx is determined by both the initial ionisation production, which is a function of the particle flux and energy spectrum, as well as transport rates. In this paper, we use the Sodankyl{\"{a}} Ion and Neurtal Chemistry (SIC) model to simulate the production of NOx from examples of the most representative particle flux and energy spectra available today of solar proton events (SPE), auroral energy electrons, and relativistic electron precipitation (REP). Large SPEs are found to produce higher initial NOx concentrations than long-lived REP events, which themselves produce higher initial NOx levels than auroral electron precipitation. Only REP microburst events were found to be insignificant in terms of generating NOx. We show that the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) observations from the Arctic winter 2003-2004 are consistent with NOx generation by a combination of SPE, auroral altitude precipitation, and long-lived REP events.

The region between the belts is normally devoid of particles2–4 , and is accordingly favoured as a location for space- craft operation because of the benign environment5 . Here we report that the outer Van Allen belt was compressed dramatically by a solar stormknown as the ‘Hallowe'en storm' of 2003. From 1 to 10 November, the outer belt had its centre only ,10,000km from Earth's equatorial surface, and the plasmasphere was similarly displaced inwards. The region between the belts became the location of high particle radiation intensity. This remarkable deformation of the entire magnetosphere implies surprisingly powerful acceleration and loss processes deep within the magnetosphere.},

@article{Rodger2003,
abstract = {The behavior of high-energy electrons trapped in the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts has been extensively studied, through both experimental and theoretical techniques. While the evidence for whistler induced electron precipitation (WEP) from the radiation belts is overwhelming, and the mechanisms behind WEP are well understood, the overall significance of WEP on radiation belt loss rates has not been clear. In this paper we investigate the L-shell variation and significance of WEP-driven loss of Van Allen belt electrons by combining in situ measurements of electron precipitation, local WEP rates determined from Trimpi perturbations, and global lightning distributions. Our modeling suggests that long-term WEP driven losses are more significant than all other inner radiation belt loss processes for electron kinetic energies in the range ∼50–150 keV in the L-shell range L = 2–2.4. These calculated lifetimes are comparable to the observed decay rates of artificially injected high-energy electrons. The upper energy limit of the WEP significance range increases with decreasing L to ∼225 keV at L = 2. For electron energies above this range manmade VLF transmitters and plasmaspheric hiss should dominate over all other loss processes. However, as our lifetimes are based on rather conservative parameter estimates, these conclusions should represent the lower bounds for the energy ranges over which WEP losses are significant. For lower L-shells the coupling of lightning activity to the production of WEP events rapidly decreases, such that by L ∼ 1.7 WEP will be unimportant in the overall loss processes.},

abstract = {Over 40 years of ground and spacecraft plasmaspheric measurements have resulted in many statistical descriptions of plasmaspheric properties. In some cases, these properties have been represented as analytical descriptions that are valid for specific regions or conditions. For the most part, what has not been done is to extend regional empirical descriptions or models to the plasmasphere as a whole. In contrast, many related investigations depend on the use of representative plasmaspheric conditions throughout the inner magnetosphere. Wave propagation, involving the transport of energy through the magnetosphere, is strongly affected by thermal plasma density and its composition. Ring current collisional and wave particle losses also strongly depend on these quantities. Plasmaspheric also plays a secondary role in influencing radio signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) is an attempt to assimilate previous empirical evidence and regional models for plasmaspheric density into a continuous, smooth model of thermal plasma density in the inner magnetosphere. In that spirit, the International Reference Ionosphere is currently used to complete the low altitude description of density and composition in the model. The models and measurements on which the GCPM is currently based and its relationship to IRI will be discussed.},

abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes {\textgreater}40 kev and proton fluxes {\textgreater}120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10−2$\gamma$, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

abstract = {Model calculations are conducted to estimate the optical emission brightness caused by lightning-induced electron precipitation. Pitch angle scattering of energetic radiation belt electrons by lightning-generated whistler mode waves results in precipitation in the upper atmosphere. Assuming a lightning peak current and location, plasmasphere distribution, and radiation belt density and pitch angle distributions, we calculate the secondary ionization production and optical emissions in a number of lines and bands. We find that the brightness in N2 1P and O(1S) may reach a few to 10 R for a 100 kA peak current discharge, with a distinct spatial and temporal signature of 1–2 s. A simple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculation shows that this signature should be detectable with modern photometric instruments with an SNR ∼4. We further investigate the dependence of this brightness on lightning source latitude and peak current.},

Besides the main objective of technological demonstration, imaging of energetic neutral atoms (ENAS) was attempted. The imager detected ENA in the energy range 0.1 - 140 keV utilizing two different techniques. Neutrals of the energy 13 - 140 keV were recorded by 14 solid state detectors with the total field of view 5 deg x 322 deg. For half a spin (approx. 1.5 s) of the ASTRID spacecraft, almost all of space was covered with an angular resolution 2.5 deg x 25 deg. Less energetic neutrals of approx. 0.1 - 70 keV were converted on a graphite target into secondary particles which then were detected by a microchannel plate with 32 anodes. A fraction of primary neutrals was directly reflected towards the sensor. This technique provided the total ENA flux with an angular resolution 4.6 deg x 11.5 deg. The instrument weight is 3.13 kg. Successful operation of the instrument during the first 5 weeks of the mission provided the first ENA images of the ring current at low altitudes.},

abstract = {A composite model of wave propagation from terrestrial very low frequency (VLF) transmitters has been constructed to estimate the wave normal angles and fields of whistler mode waves in the plasmasphere. The model combines a simulation of the fields in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, ionospheric absorption estimates, and geomagnetic field and plasma density models with fully three-dimensional ray tracing that includes refraction, focusing, and resonant damping. The outputs of this model are consistent with those of several previous, simpler simulations, some of which have underlying component models in common. A comparison of the model outputs to wavefield data from five satellites shows that away from the magnetic equator, all of the models systematically overestimate the median field strength in the plasmasphere owing to terrestrial VLF transmitters by about 20 dB at night and at least 10 dB during the day. In addition, wavefield estimates at L {\textless} 1.5 in the equatorial region appear to be about 15 dB too low, although measured fields there are extremely variable. Consideration of the models' similarities and differences indicates that this discrepancy originates in or below the ionosphere, where important physics (as yet not conclusively identified) is not being modeled. Adjustment of the low-altitude field estimates downward by constant factors brings the model outputs into closer agreement with satellite observations. It is concluded that past and future use of these widely employed trans-ionospheric VLF propagation models should be reevaluated.},

abstract = {Lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) from the Earth's radiation belt has been observed on numerous occasions with detectors on the low-altitude S81-1/SEEP satellite. A sequence of seven LEP events on September 9, 1982, and eight events on October 20, 1982, are correlated on a one-to-one basis with one-hop whistlers at Palmer, Antarctica. The temporal profile within a LEP burst has a remarkable fine structure. It is shown to be associated with bunches of magnetically guided and focused 100-to-200 keV electrons that are repeatedly scattered by the atmosphere and bounce between the northern and southern hemispheres. The delay time between the lightning sferic and the arrival of the first electron bunch increases with increasing L as predicted by the first-order gyroresonance theory. The global distribution of strong LEP events observed with the SEEP payload correlates with lightning activity and shows a preferred distribution at 2{\textless}L{\textless}3. This L shell range corresponds to the slot region in the electron radiation belt. A single LEP burst (10-3ergs-1cm-2) in the slot region is estimated to deplete {\~{}}0.001{\%} of the particles in the region covered by the burst magnetic field lines. The evidence supports the production of structured LEP by ducted rather than nonducted whistlers. It is found that ducted whistlers can be an important pitch angle diffusion mechanism for 100-250 keV electrons in the 2{\textless}L{\textless}3 range although a number of uncertainties in the various parameters remain to be resolved. It is suggested that observations of LEP can be a new tool to measure the presence and transverse dimensions of plasmaspheric whistler mode ducts.},

Outstanding characteristics of the ray paths in such a medium result from the existence of purely transverse propagation at the lower frequencies. The main purpose of this study is to confirm the Smith interpretation of the "subprotonospheric" whistlers. It is found that an enhancement of electron density at the latitude of interest can support the ray path of the fractional hop as Smith suggested, as well as a possibility of successive echoes through a single path.

We find that a recent maximum in AE or minimum in Dst provides a better model of the plasmapause radius than does maximum Kp. AE and Dst measure specific current systems (the auroral electrojet and ring current, respectively). The AE model suggests that substorms may be involved in the erosion of the plasmapause. The Dst model suggests that ring current may be formed by the same electric field that erodes the plasmapause. In more complex models, Kp and AE can describe local time structure in the plasmapause, with the furthest plasmapause before dawn at quiet times, premidnight at active times.},

@article{Kennel1966b,
abstract = {Whistler mode noise leads to electron pitch angle diffusion. Similarly, ion cyclotron noise couples to ions. This diffusion results in particle precipitation into the ionosphere and creates a pitch angle distributon of trapped particles that is unstable to further wave growth. Since excessive wave growth leads to rapid diffusion and particle loss, the requirement that the growth rate be limited to the rate at which wave energy is depleted by wave propagation permits an estimate of an upper limit to the trapped equatorial particle flux. Electron fluxes {\textgreater}40 kev and proton fluxes {\textgreater}120 kev observed on Explorers 14 and 12, respectively, obey this limit with occasional exceptions. Beyond L = 4, the fluxes are just below their limit, indicating that an unspecified acceleration source, sufficient to keep the trapped particles near their precipitation limit, exists. Limiting proton and electron fluxes are roughly equal, suggesting a partial explanation for the existence of larger densities of high-energy protons than of electrons. Observed electron pitch angle profiles correspond to a diffusion coefficient in agreement with observed lifetimes. The required equatorial whistler mode wide band noise intensity, 10−2$\gamma$, is not obviously inconsistent with observations and is consistent with the lifetime and with limiting trapped particle intensity.},

From 1 to 10 November, the outer belt had its centre only ,10,000km from Earth's equatorial surface, and the plasmasphere was similarly displaced inwards.

abstract = {Observations of lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) events at three geographic regions show characteristics which systematically vary with both longitude and hemisphere. These observations are quantitatively interpreted using a novel atmospheric interaction model designed to predict the characteristics of LEP events at any longitude and midlatitude L-shell by accounting for the effects of precipitating electrons which are backscattered from the atmosphere. The model of atmospheric backscatter (ABS) calculates atmospheric backscatter responses for individual monoenergetic electron beams with a single incident pitch angle using a Monte Carlo model of atmospheric interactions. The ABS model also includes an asymmetric (non-ideal dipole) geomagnetic field model in calculations of the pitch angle of backscattered electrons entering the conjugate hemisphere. Using a realistic distribution of precipitating electrons, the results of this backscatter calculation at three separate longitudes are compared with VLF remote sensing data collected on nearly north-south great circle paths (GCPs). Results predicted by the model and confirmed by data indicate that all four primary LEP characteristics exhibit longitudinal and hemispheric dependence which can be explained in terms of precipitating electrons backscattered from the atmosphere. By combining these effects with previously calculated radiation belt electron loss rates due to lightning at a single location it is possible to estimate the global loss of radiation belt electrons due to lightning.},

abstract = {This work builds on and extends our previous effort (Tsyganenko et al., 2003) to develop a dynamical model of the storm-time geomagnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, using space magnetometer data taken during 37 major events in 1996–2000 and concurrent observations of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The essence of the approach is to derive from the data the temporal variation of all major current systems contributing to the distant geomagnetic field during the entire storm cycle, using a simple model of their growth and decay. Each principal source of the external magnetic field (magnetopause, cross-tail current sheet, axisymmetric and partial ring currents, and Birkeland current systems) is driven by a separate variable, calculated as a time integral of a combination of geoeffective parameters NlVbBs g, where N, V, and Bs are the solar wind density, speed, and the magnitude of the southward component of the IMF, respectively. In this approach we assume that each source has its individual relaxation timescale and residual quiet-time strength, and its partial contribution to the total field depends on the entire history of the external driving of the magnetosphere during a storm. In addition, the magnitudes of the principal field sources were assumed to saturate during extremely large storms with abnormally strong external driving. All the parameters of the model field sources, including their magnitudes, geometrical characteristics, solar wind/IMF driving functions, decay timescales, and saturation thresholds, were treated as free variables, and their values were derived from the data. As an independent consistency test, we calculated the expected Dst variation on the basis of the model output at Earth's surface and compared it with the actual observed Dst. A good agreement (cumulative correlation coefficient R = 0.92) was found, in spite of the fact that  90{\%} of the spacecraft data used in the fitting were taken at synchronous orbit and beyond, while only 3.7{\%} of those data came from distances 2.5   R   4 RE. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility to develop a truly dynamical model of the magnetic field, based on magnetospheric and interplanetary data and allowing one to reproduce and forecast the entire process of a geomagnetic storm, as it unfolds in time and space.},

abstract = {Geospace phenomena such as the aurora, plasma motion, ionospheric currents and associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth's main magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the charged particles that comprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but not across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena relative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate systems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the magnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common magnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are used, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of the Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most detailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic latitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These coordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are non-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such coordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done correctly.},

abstract = {Energetic electrons (E {\textgreater} 100 keV) in the Earth's radiation belts undergo Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonant interactions with a variety of whistler mode waves leading to pitch angle scattering and subsequent loss to the atmosphere. In this study we assess the relative importance of plasmaspheric hiss and lightning-generated whistlers in the slot region and beyond. Electron loss timescales are determined using the Pitch Angle and energy Diffusion of Ions and Electrons (PADIE) code with global models of the spectral distributions of the wave power based on CRRES observations. Our results show that plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles is a significant scattering agent in the slot region and beyond. In contrast, plasmaspheric hiss propagating at large wave normal angles and lightning-generated whistlers do not contribute significantly to radiation belt loss. The loss timescale of 2 MeV electrons due to plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small and intermediate wave normal angles in the center of the slot region (L = 2.5) lies in the range 1–10 days, consistent with recent Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) observations. Wave turbulence in space, which is responsible for the generation plasmaspheric hiss, thus leads to the formation of the slot region. During active periods, losses due to plasmaspheric hiss may occur on a timescale of 1 day or less for a wide range of energies, 200 keV {\textless} E {\textless} 1 MeV, in the region 3.5 {\textless} L {\textless} 4.0. Plasmaspheric hiss may thus also be a significant loss process in the inner region of the outer radiation belt during magnetically disturbed periods.},

abstract = {Previous results of plasmapause position surveys have been synthesized into a description of the underlying global distribution of plasmasphere-like or core plasma densities unique to a steady state magnetosphere. Under these steady conditions, the boundary between high- and low-density regions is taken to represent the boundary between diurnal near-corotation and large-scale circulation streamlines that traverse the entire magnetosphere. Results indicate a boundary that has a pronounced bulge in the dusk sector that is rotated westward and markedly reduced in size at increased levels of geomagnetic activity (and presumably magnetospheric convection). The derived profile is empirical confirmation of an underlying “tear drop” distribution of core plasma, which is valid only for prolonged steady conditions and is somewhat different from that associated with the simple superposition of sunward flow and corotation, both in its detailed shape and in its varying orientation. Variation away from the tear drop profile suggests that magnetospheric circulation departs from a uniform flow field, having a radial dependence with respect to the Earth that is qualitatively consistent with electrostatic shielding of the convection electric field and which is rotated westward at increased levels of geophysical activity.},

abstract = {Transient perturbations of subionospheric very low frequency (VLF) radiowave signals provide new evidence for lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) events involving short ({\textless} 1 s) bursts of {\textgreater} 1 MeV electrons from the earth's inner radiation belt at L {\&}le; 1.8. The signal amplitude changes are attributed to increased absorption in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and{\&}sol;or alterations of the waveguide mode structure due to localized secondary ionization enhancements produced in the nighttime lower ionosphere and the mesosphere by the precipitating electrons. The otherwise stably trapped electrons are believed to be scattered in pitch angle during cyclotron resonant interactions in the magnetosphere with the lightning-generated whistler waves. That some precipitation bursts consist partly of MeV electrons is suggested by (i) confinement of the perturbed subionospheric signal path to low magnetic latitudes ( L {\&}le; 1.8), for which corresponding electron energies for gyroresonance with typical whistler-wave frequencies in the magnetosphere are {\textgreater} 1 MeV, and (ii) the temporal signatures of the perturbation events, which often exhibit an unusually rapid initial recovery (time constant of {\&}tau; {\textless} 1 s) followed by further recovery at rates believed characteristic of less energetic events ({\&}tau; {\&}sim; 5-20 s). The latter is interpreted as a manifestation of the rapid variation with altitude of the effective loss rate for excess ionization over an exceptionally wide range of mesospheric altitudes (40-70 km) penetrated by the {\textgreater} 1 MeV electrons.},

Inan (2008) is used to model trans-ionospheric propagation of VLF electromagnetic waves from ground-based transmitters up to satellite altitudes. Direct comparison with satellite observations indicates that the VLF wave intensities measured at satellite altitudes are substantially smaller than predicted. The apparent reduction in amplitude is attributed to the presence of irregularities in the ionosphere, which the waves encounter during their traversal of the lower ionosphere. Linear mode scattering from the irregularities convert the whistler waves into quasi-electrostatic whistler mode (QEWM) waves with wave normal angles near the resonance cone. Recent enhancements to the FWM are also described, which allow the minimization of an aliasing error encountered in taking the inverse Fourier transform.},

abstract = {High-resolution measurements of subionospheric VLF signals at multiple sites are used as a new tool to assess the spatial distribution and occurrence of ionospheric disturbances associated with lightning-induced electron precipitation. Simultaneous observations in California, Saskatchewan, and Quebec of VLF signals from multiple sources allow the monitoring of event activity over a coarse grid covering the continental United States. Association of the observed VLF signal perturbations with lightning is often made on the basis of time correlation with prominent radio atmospherics. Simultaneous observations of individual events on subionospheric paths that “cross” one another are used to locate the disturbed ionospheric region(s). Absence of perturbations on nearby paths permits assessment of the spatial extent of the region with a varying degree of accuracy, depending on the distribution of signal paths. In one case distinctly different onset delays (with respect to causative discharges) consistent with predictions of whistler-particle scattering theory were found, and were interpreted as being due to two separate regions separated in L value by ∼0.4 L being excited in individual events. Occurrence statistics over the course of October 1987 exhibit generally higher levels of activity at the lower-latitude end of the 2 {\textless} L {\textless} 4 range, although it is difficult to separately assess the role of the source lightning distribution. Occurrence statistics of simultaneous events on crossing paths are consistent with the spatial extent of the disturbed ionospheric regions being less than a few hundred kilometers. The occurrence statistics also suggest that scattering from disturbances located at distances of {\textgreater}100 km off the great circle paths is not significant.},

The original mathematical form of the diffusive equilibrium model was based on the hydrostatic equilibrium along the magnetic field line with the centrifugal force and the field-aligned electrostatic force as well as a large number of simplifying approximations. Six free parameters in the mathematical form have been conventionally determined from observations. We evaluate four sets of the parameters that have been reported in the literature. The evaluation is made according to the equatorial radial distance dependence, latitudinal dependence at a given radial distance, and the combined radial and latitudinal dependences. We find that the mathematical form given in the diffusive equilibrium model is intrinsically incompatible with the measurements unless another large number of free parameters are artificially introduced, which essentially changes the nature of a theoretical model to an empirical model.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents results and analysis regarding the use of anthropogenic ground-based and space-based Very Low Frequency (VLF) transmitters to precipitate energetic electrons in the inner radiation belt. While existing ground-based VLF transmitters already precipitate energetic electrons, they do so inadvertently. In this work, we consider sources designed specifically for the purpose of precipitating {\textgreater}100 keV electrons. This concept is termed controlled precipitation. We focus on this energy range because these electrons are most damaging from a so-called space weather perspective. We initially consider the distribution of whistler-mode wave energy from space- based sources distributed in L -shell and geomagnetic latitude. We also incorporate the effects of VLF antenna radiation immersed in a magnetoplasma. Our results demonstrate that a space-based source, by varying the frequency of the injected waves, can target L -shells both higher and lower than the source site, with wave frequencies below (above) the local lower hybrid resonance frequency moving to higher (lower) L -shells. We show that only three sources placed at various locations in the inner magnetosphere are required to project wave power over the range 1.4{\textless}= L {\textless}=2.7, which comprises the bulk of the inner radiation belt. We also calculate the energetic electron precipitation that would be induced by waves injected by such sources. The waves injected by space-based sources propagate with highly oblique wave normal angles close to the local resonance cone. In contrast with previous analysis, we show that these waves do induce substantial {\textgreater}1 MeV electron precipitation. Compared to a single-pass interaction, highly oblique magnetospherically reflecting whistler- mode waves precipitate up to 16 times more 100 keV to 5 MeV electrons. Waves injected at initial wave normal angles closer to the magnetic field, e.g., 45°, in fact precipitate fewer {\textgreater}1 MeV electrons than waves injected close to the resonance cone. We also investigate the tradeoffs among source location, operating frequency and radiated power for ground-based VLF sources designed to precipitate energetic electrons in the inner radiation belts. We determine energetic electron precipitation signatures induced by five existing ground-based VLF sources as well as five different hypothetical transmitters distributed broadly in geomagnetic latitude with a wide range of operating frequencies. We show that source location affects induced precipitation more strongly than operating frequency or radiated power. Sources located at 35° to 45° induce the most {\textgreater}100 keV precipitation for the 10 to 40 kHz waves typical of ground-based VLF sources, while locations below l{\~{}}=15° or above l{\~{}}=55° are least effective at precipitating energetic electrons. In all cases, induced precipitation increases as the operating frequency decreases, with 10 kHz waves from a source at l{\~{}}=35° the most effective at precipitating {\textgreater}100 keV electrons. Precipitation signatures produced by five existing ground-based VLF transmitters are also simulated: the NAA, NLK, NAU, NPM, and NWC VLF transmitters. Among these, the NWC transmitter located at a geomagnetic latitude of 31.7° in western Australia induces the strongest {\textgreater}100 keV electron precipitation signature, followed by the NPM, NAU, NAA and NLK transmitters.},

abstract = {Lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP) from the Earth's radiation belt has been observed on numerous occasions with detectors on the low-altitude S81-1/SEEP satellite. A sequence of seven LEP events on September 9, 1982, and eight events on October 20, 1982, are correlated on a one-to-one basis with one-hop whistlers at Palmer, Antarctica. The temporal profile within a LEP burst has a remarkable fine structure. It is shown to be associated with bunches of magnetically guided and focused 100-to-200 keV electrons that are repeatedly scattered by the atmosphere and bounce between the northern and southern hemispheres. The delay time between the lightning sferic and the arrival of the first electron bunch increases with increasing L as predicted by the first-order gyroresonance theory. The global distribution of strong LEP events observed with the SEEP payload correlates with lightning activity and shows a preferred distribution at 2{\textless}L{\textless}3. This L shell range corresponds to the slot region in the electron radiation belt. A single LEP burst (10-3ergs-1cm-2) in the slot region is estimated to deplete {\~{}}0.001{\%} of the particles in the region covered by the burst magnetic field lines. The evidence supports the production of structured LEP by ducted rather than nonducted whistlers. It is found that ducted whistlers can be an important pitch angle diffusion mechanism for 100-250 keV electrons in the 2{\textless}L{\textless}3 range although a number of uncertainties in the various parameters remain to be resolved. It is suggested that observations of LEP can be a new tool to measure the presence and transverse dimensions of plasmaspheric whistler mode ducts.},

It is found that chorus normalized occurrence peaks when the plasmapause is at L ∼ 2.6, somewhat higher than Palmer's L shell, and that this occurrence peak persists across a range of observed chorus frequencies. Next, reverse ray tracing is employed to evaluate the portion of the equatorial chorus source region, distributed in radial distance and wave normal, from which chorus is able to reach Palmer Station via propagation in a nonducted mode. The results of ray tracing are similar to those of observations, with a peak of expected occurrence when the plasmapause is at L ∼ 3. The exact location of the peak is frequency dependent. This supports the conclusion that the ability of chorus to propagate to low altitudes and the ground is a strong function of instantaneous plasmapause extent and that peak occurrence of chorus at a given ground station may occur when the L shell of the plasmapause is somewhat beyond that of the observing station. These results also suggest that chorus observed on the ground at midlatitude stations propagates predominantly in the nonducted mode. },

abstract = {The origin of whistler mode radiation in the plasmasphere is examined from 3 years of plasma wave observations from the Dynamics Explorer and the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration spacecraft. These data are used to construct plasma wave intensity maps of whistler mode radiation in the plasmasphere. The highest average intensities of the radiation in the wave maps show source locations and/or sites of wave amplification. Each type of wave is classified on the basis of its magnetic latitude and longitude rather than any spectral feature. Equatorial electromagnetic (EM) emissions (∼30–330 Hz), plasmaspheric hiss (∼330 Hz to 3.3 kHz), chorus (∼2–6 kHz), and VLF transmitters (∼10–50 kHz) are the main types of waves that are clearly delineated in the plasma wave maps. Observations of the equatorial EM emissions show that the most intense region is on or near the magnetic equator in the afternoon sector and that during times of negative B z (interplanetary magnetic field) the maximum intensity moves from L values of 3 to {\textless}2. These observations are consistent with the origin of this emission being particle-wave interactions in or near the magnetic equator. Plasmaspheric hiss shows high intensity at high latitudes and low altitudes (L shells from 2 to 4) and in the magnetic equator with L values from 2 to 3 in the early afternoon sector. The longitudinal distribution of the hiss intensity (excluding the enhancement at the equator) is similar to the distribution of lightning: stronger over continents than over the ocean, stronger in the summer than in the winter, and stronger on the dayside than on the nightside. These observations strongly support lightning as the dominant source for plasmaspheric hiss, which, through particle-wave interactions, maintains the slot region in the radiation belts. The enhancement of hiss at the magnetic equator is consistent with particle-wave interactions. The chorus emissions are most intense on the morningside as previously reported. At frequencies from ∼10 to ∼50 kHz, VLF transmitters dominate the spectrum. The maximum intensity of the VLF transmitters is in the late evening or early morning with enhancements all along L shells from 1.8 to 3.},

The main purpose of this study is to confirm the Smith interpretation of the "subprotonospheric" whistlers. It is found that an enhancement of electron density at the latitude of interest can support the ray path of the fractional hop as Smith suggested, as well as a possibility of successive echoes through a single path. The effect of collisions on propagation is also discussed.},

abstract = {A new combined ray tracing and test particle formulation is presented which calculates the spatiotemporal electron precipitation flux signatures at ionospheric altitudes induced by obliquely propagating lightning-generated whistler waves. The formulation accounts for the variation in wave characteristics (frequency-time dispersion, wave normal angle, and power density) as the whistler generated by an individual lightning discharge propagates through vast volumes of the magnetosphere in the absence of field-aligned cold plasma density enhancements, and calculates the detailed gyroresonance scattering of trapped energetic electrons into the atmospheric loss cone over a broad range of field lines (L shells) to determine the precipitation flux over extensive ionospheric regions. Results show that peak precipitation flux patches (hotspots) several tens of degrees of latitude and longitude in size develop at locations ∼7° to ∼20° poleward of the discharge as a consequence of propagation paths which convey wave energy from lower to higher L shells. For oblique whistler intensities matching satellite observations (10 to 30 pT) peak flux levels of several milli-ergs cm−2 s−1 are indicated, arriving as early as ∼ 1/4 s and lasting ∼1/2 s at lower observing latitudes (e.g., ∼32° for North American longitudes), while being delayed to ∼l s or more and lasting up to ∼2 s at higher latitudes (∼47°), creating a sense of poleward hotspot motion. Summary profiles integrated over time, latitude and L shell suggest that lightning-generated oblique whistler-induced electron precipitation deposits appreciable energy to the upper atmosphere at midlatitudes and contributes significantly to the loss of energetic ({\textgreater}100 keV) radiation belt electrons, particularly over 2.2 ≤ L ≤ 3.5 where the slot region forms.},

Over the United States, energetic electron fluxes in the slot region (between L = 2 and 3) are significantly higher in the northern summer than in the winter, consistent with the seasonal variation of lightning activity in the Northern Hemisphere. The association of precipitating fluxes with lightning is explored using lightning location data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and VLF wave data on DEMETER. The increased precipitation of particles into the drift loss cone over the Northern Hemisphere in summer is consistent with expected pitch-angle scattering by lightning-generated whistler waves, indicating that lightning is a significant contributor to the loss of slot region electrons.},

abstract = {Phase and amplitude perturbations (trimpis) on VLF signals propagating in the earth-ionosphere waveguide are usually explained in terms of precipitation-induced modification along the great circle path as though it were a one-dimensional (1-D) waveguide. The alternative 2-D view presented here is that precipitation-induced ionization patches, laterally displaced from the great circle path, produce echoes at the receiver slightly delayed relative to the direct signal. Interference between the direct and echo signals can produce both phase and amplitude trimpis of both signs. Single-mode propagation is assumed here, since it is likely that the second mode amplitude exceeded that of the first by ∼12 dB. We apply this theory to a sequence of trimpis observed on the North West Cape (NWC)-Dunedin path on July 10, 1987. This indicates a north–south drift of the precipitation region consistent with drift speeds of whistler ducts. The theory is also applied to events published in the literature.},

abstract = {The flux of relativistic electrons in the Earth's radiation belts is highly variable and can change by orders of magnitude on timescales of a few hours. Understanding the drivers for these changes is important as energetic electrons can damage satellites. We present results from a new code, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Radiation Belt model, which solves a 3-D Fokker-Planck equation, following a similar approach to the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) code, incorporating the effects of radial diffusion, wave-particle interactions, and collisions. Whistler mode chorus waves, plasmaspheric hiss, and lightning-generated whistlers (LGW) are modeled using new diffusion coefficients, calculated by the Pitch Angle and Energy Diffusion of Ions and Electrons (PADIE) code, with new wave models based on satellite data that have been parameterized by both the AE and Kp indices. The model for plasmaspheric hiss and LGW includes variation in the wave-normal angle distribution of the waves with latitude. Simulations of 100 days from the CRRES mission demonstrate that the inclusion of chorus waves in the model is needed to reproduce the observed increase in MeV flux during disturbed conditions. The model reproduces the variation of the radiation belts best when AE, rather than Kp, is used to determine the diffusion rates. Losses due to plasmaspheric hiss depend critically on the the wave-normal angle distribution; a model where the peak of the wave-normal angle distribution depends on latitude best reproduces the observed decay rates. Higher frequency waves (∼1-2 kHz) only make a significant contribution to losses for L{\^{a}}̂ -{\textless}3 and the highest frequencies (2-5 kHz), representing LGW, have a limited effect on MeV electrons for 2{\textless}L{\^{a}}̂ -{\textless}5.5.

abstract = {Lightning discharges generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak component in the very low frequency (VLF; 3–30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range (≤6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1–4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between ∼40 and 60{\%} is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

abstract = {The flux of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt can vary by several orders of magnitude over time scales less than a day, in response to changes in properties of the solar wind instigated by solar activity. Variability in the radiation belts is due to an imbalance between the dominant source and loss processes, caused by a violation of one or more of the adiabatic invariants. For radiation belt electrons, non‐adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understand- ing and global modeling of such wave‐particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents a study of several aspects of the resonant interaction be- tween energetic radiation-belt electrons and lightning generated, magnetospherically- re°ecting (MR) whistler mode waves in the inner magnetosphere. We initially develop a ¯rst-order model to estimate the L-shell dependence of the precipitation °ux of energetic electrons driven by MR whistlers injected at 25±, 35±, and 45± geomagnetic latitude, assuming ¯rst a horizontally strati¯ed ionosphere and then an ionosphere containing realistic horizontal density gradients as given by the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model. Results indicate that in the region 1:4 {\textless} L {\textless} 1:62, a narrow (in L-shell extent) peak in the precipitation signature can result due to the focusing of the whistler wave packet on the ¯rst magnetospheric traverse. A wide bulge is formed in the region L{\textgreater}1:8 due to subsequent $\backslash$hops" of the whistler wave energy, and the tendency of the whistler to move slowly outward in L with each hop. By examining the °ux of electrons with energy {\textgreater}150 keV, we obtain excellent agreement with measurements of °ux enhancements observed in the drift loss-cone, aboard the SAMPEX satellite. We then turn our attention to the detailed calculation of the frequency-time (f¡ t) characteristics and power of an MR whistler generated by a single cloud-ground discharge at a given latitude, as it would appear on a satellite at any point in the magnetosphere. By developing an extensive ray tracing and interpolation technique, we simulate a whistler observed aboard the OGO 1 satellite to ¯nd excellent agreement between theory and measurement. We then simulate the f¡t spectra that would be produced by lightning injection latitudes of 25±, 35±, 45± and 55± geomagnetic latitude, and observed on the geomagnetic equator at L = 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4. We vary the cold iv plasma density distribution through which the whistler wave propagates, and obtain MR whistler signatures that clearly re°ect the properties of the medium traversed by the wave. Using the formulation described above, we compute the f ¡t spectra of an MR whistler at 1± latitude bins along a given ¯eld line, thus estimating the wave structure as a function of frequency and time. By treating the pitch-angle scattering in each latitude bin as being incoherent with respect to that produced in any other latitude bin, we calculate the precipitated °ux of energetic electrons as a function of time, at every latitude bin on the ¯eld-line, including gyro-harmonic resonance interactions of order +5 to ¡5, as well as the zero order or Landau resonance. We use a realistic AE8 °ux distribution for the trapped °ux composing the radiation belts, with a sinusoidal pitch-angle distribution tending to zero at the loss-cone. Results indicate that MR whistler-induced precipitation episodes can last for tens of seconds and moves to higher L-shells (and hence latitudes) on both short (0.1 sec) and long (10 sec) timescales, covering a geographic region measuring hundreds of kilometers. We conclude that the °ux of precipitating, energetic, radiation belt electrons driven by lightning generated magnetospherically re°ecting whistler waves is con- sistently detectable in the drift loss cone, and produces unique signatures which can be detected using either satellite-borne instruments or ground-based techniques.},

abstract = {Electric field spectrum measurements from the plasma wave instrument on the Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft are used to study the local electron density at high altitudes in the northern polar cap region. The electron density is determined from the upper cutoff of whistler mode radiation at the electron plasma frequency. Median density values over the polar cap at L greater than 10 are found to vary from 35.2±8.5 cm−3 at 2.1 RE to 0.99±0.51 cm−3 at 4.66 RE. The steady state radial outflow model is examined for consistency with the observed density profile. A power law fit to the radial variation of the electron density yields an exponent of −3.85±0.32, which for the radial outflow model implies a flow velocity increasing nearly linearly with increasing radial distance. Comparison of the observed electron densities with theoretical polar wind densities yields consistent results up to 2.8 RE. A comparison of the observed electron densities with low-altitude density profiles from the Alouette II and ISIS 1 spacecraft illustrate transitions in the slope of the profile at 1.16 RE and between 1.55 and 2.0 RE. The changes in the density profile suggest that changes occur in the basic radial transport processes at these altitudes.},
