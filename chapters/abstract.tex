Surrounding the Earth are two shells of high-energy electrons and ions known as the Van Allen Radiation Belts. As early as their first measurements in 1958, scientists and engineers have recognized the hazards posed by high-energy particles to spacecraft and astronauts. The dynamics of the radiation belts are governed by a complex balance of sources and loss processes, collectively resulting in populations which persist between days and months. Global lightning discharges have been theorized to be an important loss function for radiation belt electrons through a process known as Lightning- Induced Electron Precipitation (LEP). However, a lack of \emph{in situ} measurements has precluded a quantitative global study. 

Here we present an investigation of the spatial and temporal morphology of lightning-induced electron precipitation. We seek to quantitatively determine the regions in space, time, and electron energy, where LEP may be of importance, using a combination of numerical raytracing and resonant interaction modeling, driven by a realistic measurement of global lightning activity from the GLD360 lightning detection network.

We first provide an estimate of the persistent radio energy due to whistler mode, VLF waves generated by terrestrial cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in the near-Earth space environment using cold plasma numerical raytracing. Variation is explored with respect to McIlwain L shell, longitude, frequency, and geomagnetic activity using the K$_p$ index. We include updated ionospheric absorption curves and an improved 4-dimensional interpolation algorithm. We find that the persistent energy decays logarithmically with increasing L-shell and frequency.

We then apply our raytracing and interpolation apparatus to simulate the precipitating electron flux resulting from single lightning strokes, and extrapolate over the GLD360 dataset to determine estimated locations of elevated electron precipitation. We compute the estimated lifetime of geomagnetically trapped electron populations, subject solely to LEP-induced losses, as a function of L-shell and electron energy. Our estimates are consistent with measurements in the 100keV -- 1 MeV energy range; however our results suggest that LEP may be a substantial loss mechanism for lower energy, suprathermal electrons in the 100 eV -- 10 keV range. We do not find any notable enhancement in the slot region, suggesting that resonant interactions with lightning-generated whistlers are not a significant contributor to slot region morphology.

Finally we present a design for a VLF radio receiver, intended for deployment on a 3-unit (10 $\times$ 10 $\times$ 30 cm) CubeSat bus, which can be used in conjunction with an onboard electron energy spectrometer to make direct, \emph{in situ} measurements of precipitating electrons and their causative whistler waves. The receiver was designed with radiation tolerance in mind, and includes a novel onboard data processing system, implemented entirely in an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) using the Verilog hardware description language.
