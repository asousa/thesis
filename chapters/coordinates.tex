\section{Coordinate Systems}
In dealing with any geographic system, one will almost surely run into difficulty with coordinate systems. Most research fields make use of different coordinate systems which better-suit the minutia of their work. Since LEP is a large-scale coupling process which spans several different regions of the Earth and Space Environment, it is useful to discuss the coordinate systems we will use, and the processes of mapping from frame to frame. For an in-depth review of many additional coordinate systems, see the work by \cite{Laundal2016}.
